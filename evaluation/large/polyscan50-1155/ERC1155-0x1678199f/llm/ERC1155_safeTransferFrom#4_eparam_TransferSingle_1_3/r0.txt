The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `id` argument which represents the token type being transferred. The event is emitted after the balance update and before the safe transfer acceptance check, which is consistent with the ERC-1155 standard for single token transfers.
