YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function checks if `msg.sender` is either the owner of the tokens or an approved operator before proceeding with the transfer. This is done with the following line:

```solidity
if (from != msg.sender && !_operatorApprovals[from][msg.sender])
    revert NotTokenOwnerOrApproved();
```

If the check passes, the function calls `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, which performs the actual transfer of tokens. After updating the balances, the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function emits the `TransferBatch` event:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(msg.sender, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

Here, `msg.sender` is used as the `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, which is consistent with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer and should be `msg.sender`. Therefore, the event `TransferBatch` is emitted according to the given rule.
