The `Airdrop` function iterates over the `itemsIds` array and for each item ID, it increments the balance of the corresponding address in the `to` array by 1. After updating the balance, it emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct arguments, including the item ID (`itemsIds[i]`) as the `_id` argument, which according to the rule must be the token type being transferred. The `_value` is set to 1, which is the amount being transferred for each airdrop. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted according to the given rule.
