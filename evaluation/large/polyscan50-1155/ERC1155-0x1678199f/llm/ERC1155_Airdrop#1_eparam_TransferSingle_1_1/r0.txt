NO

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument, which indicates that the tokens are being minted or created, rather than transferred from an existing holder. The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, but in the case of an airdrop, there is no existing holder from whom the balance is decreased. Instead, new tokens are being added to the recipients' balances. Therefore, the event does not follow the given rule for a standard transfer, but it does follow the convention for minting new tokens.
