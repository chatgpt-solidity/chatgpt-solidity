The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_from` argument being the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, as required by the rule. This is done in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` private function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` external function. The `TransferBatch` event is emitted just before the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, ensuring that the balances have been updated and the event reflects the state change.
