YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_operator` as `msg.sender`, `_from` as the `from` address, `_to` as the `to` address, `_ids` as the list of token IDs (`ids`), and `_values` as the corresponding list of amounts (`amounts`) being transferred. This matches the rule that the `_ids` argument must be the list of tokens being transferred.
