The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule. The event is emitted just before the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, which ensures that the balances have already been updated accordingly.
