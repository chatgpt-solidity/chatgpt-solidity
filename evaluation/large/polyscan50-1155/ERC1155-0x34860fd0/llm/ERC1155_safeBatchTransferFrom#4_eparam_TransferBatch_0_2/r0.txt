The `TransferBatch` event is emitted within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and before the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called.

The event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the transfer (in this case `msg.sender`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being transferred.
- `_ids`: An array of token IDs.
- `_values`: An array of the amounts of tokens being transferred.

The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. In the provided function, the `_to` argument is indeed the address to which the tokens are being transferred, and the balances for that address are increased accordingly within the loop:

```solidity
_balances[ids[i]][to] += amounts[i];
```

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
