The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event for each item minted in the batch. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument set to the address of the recipient (`to[i]`) whose balance is increased by 1 for the item with ID `itemsIds[i]`. This is in accordance with the given rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
