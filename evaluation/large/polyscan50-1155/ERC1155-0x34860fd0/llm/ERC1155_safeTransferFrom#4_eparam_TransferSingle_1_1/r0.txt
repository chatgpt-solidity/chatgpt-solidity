The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, as required by the rule. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted after the balance of the `_from` address is decreased and the balance of the `_to` address is increased, which is the correct behavior for a transfer event according to the ERC-1155 standard.
