NO

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument, which is correct when tokens are being minted (created) because they are coming from a zero address, indicating that they are new and not transferred from an existing holder. The rule provided states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, but in the case of minting new tokens, there is no holder from whom the balance is decreased, as the tokens are being created rather than transferred.

Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted correctly according to the rule for minting new tokens.
