The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is called within the `airdrop` function of the `RecipientNFT` contract, which inherits from `ERC1155`.

The `_mint` function sets the `operator` to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the `Context` contract. This means that the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event will be the address that initiated the transaction, which is the expected behavior according to the given rule.

The `airdrop` function is also protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the owner of the contract can call this function. Therefore, when the `TransferSingle` event is emitted, the `_operator` will be the owner of the contract, who is approved to make the transfer, satisfying the rule that "_operator argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender)".
