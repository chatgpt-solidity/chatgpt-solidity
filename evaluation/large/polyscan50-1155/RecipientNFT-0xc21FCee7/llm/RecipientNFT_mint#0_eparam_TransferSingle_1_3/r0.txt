The `mint` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract calls the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract with the following arguments:

```solidity
_mint(to, coinbase, 1, "");
```

Here, `coinbase` is the token ID (`_id`) being transferred, and the amount (`_value`) is `1`. The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `id` and `amount` that were passed to it:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```

Since the `coinbase` variable is used as the token ID and is passed directly to the `TransferSingle` event, the rule that "_The `_id` argument MUST be the token type being transferred_" is followed. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
