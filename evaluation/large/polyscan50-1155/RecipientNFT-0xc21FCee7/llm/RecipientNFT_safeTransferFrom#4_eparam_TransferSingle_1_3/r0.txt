YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments as per the rule. The `_id` argument is indeed the token type being transferred, and the other arguments (`_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_value`) are also correctly passed to the event. The event is emitted after the token balance update and before the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, which is the correct order of operations for the ERC-1155 standard.
