The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, as required by the rule.

Here's the relevant part of the code that shows the `TransferBatch` event being emitted with the correct arguments:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

In this line, the `from` variable is used as the `_from` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, which is the address from which the tokens are being transferred, thus decreasing the balance of the `from` address. The `operator` is the address that initiated the transfer (which could be the token owner or an approved operator), `to` is the recipient address, `ids` is the array of token IDs, and `amounts` is the corresponding array of token amounts to be transferred.
