The `TransferBatch` event is emitted correctly according to the given rule. The `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function ensures that the `ids` and `amounts` arrays have the same length, and it performs the balance updates for each token ID and amount pair before emitting the `TransferBatch` event. The event is emitted with the `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, and `amounts` arguments, where `amounts` represent the list of number of tokens that the holder's balance is decreased by and that the recipient's balance is increased by, matching the list and order of tokens specified in `ids`. This behavior aligns with the rule specified for the `TransferBatch` event.
