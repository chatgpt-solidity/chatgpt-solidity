The `airdrop` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract is designed to mint a new token of type `coinbase` to each address in the `recipients` array, provided that the address is not a contract. The `_mint` function is called with the `coinbase` as the `id` argument, which is the token type being transferred. The `_mint` function internally calls the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook, updates the balances, emits the `TransferSingle` event, calls the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook, and finally performs the safe transfer acceptance check.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted within the `_mint` function with the correct arguments, including the `_id` argument set to `coinbase`, which is the token type being transferred. The rule specified is therefore followed, and the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
