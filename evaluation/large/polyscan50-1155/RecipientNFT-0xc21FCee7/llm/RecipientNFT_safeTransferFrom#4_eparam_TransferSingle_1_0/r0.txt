YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or an approved operator for the `from` address before proceeding with the transfer. This is done by the `require` statement that checks if `from` is equal to `_msgSender()` or if `_msgSender()` is approved for all (`isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender())`).

Later in the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function, the `operator` variable is set to `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction. This `operator` variable is then used as the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event emission.

Since the `operator` is set to the `msg.sender` and the `msg.sender` must be approved to make the transfer (as checked at the beginning of the `safeTransferFrom` function), the rule is followed, and the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct `_operator` argument.
