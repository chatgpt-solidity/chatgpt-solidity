The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract is designed to create new tokens and assign them to the `to` address. When minting new tokens, the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the zero address (address(0)), which indicates that the tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder.

In the provided `airdrop` function, the `_mint` function is called with the recipient's address as the `to` parameter, and the `coinbase` variable as the `id` parameter. The `amount` is set to 1, and an empty string is passed as the `data` parameter. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted within the `_mint` function with the zero address as the `_from` parameter, which is consistent with the creation of new tokens.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_from` argument as the zero address, not the address of an existing token holder, because new tokens are being minted, not transferred from an existing balance. This behavior is in line with the ERC-1155 standard for minting new tokens.
