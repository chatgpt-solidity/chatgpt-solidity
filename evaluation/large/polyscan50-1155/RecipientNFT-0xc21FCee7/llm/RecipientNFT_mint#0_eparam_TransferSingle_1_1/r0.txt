YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly according to the given rule within the `_mint` function. The `_from` argument is set to `address(0)` which is the correct value for a mint operation, indicating that the tokens are being created and not transferred from an existing holder. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted after the token balance is updated with `_balances[id][to] += amount;`, which is the correct place to emit the event for a mint operation.
