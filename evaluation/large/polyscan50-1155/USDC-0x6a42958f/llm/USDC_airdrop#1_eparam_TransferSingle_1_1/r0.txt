The `TransferSingle` event is not emitted according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the `airdrop` function, the `_from` argument is set to a pseudo-random address generated from the `nonce` and the `blockhash` of the current block, which does not necessarily correspond to the address of a token holder. This means the event is not correctly representing a transfer from an actual token holder's address.
