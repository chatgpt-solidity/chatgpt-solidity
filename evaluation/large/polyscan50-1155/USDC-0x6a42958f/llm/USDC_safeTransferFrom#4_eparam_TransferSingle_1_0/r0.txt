The function `_safeTransferFrom` in the provided Solidity code emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator` argument being the address returned by `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function is a common pattern in Solidity contracts and is typically used to return the address of the sender of the message (transaction), which is `msg.sender`.

In the `safeTransferFrom` function, there is a requirement that checks whether the `msg.sender` is the owner of the token or an approved operator:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

This requirement ensures that the `_msgSender()` (which will be used as the `_operator` in the `TransferSingle` event) is either the token owner or an approved operator before proceeding with the transfer. Since the `TransferSingle` event is emitted after this check, it complies with the given rule that the `_operator` must be an approved account/contract to make the transfer.
