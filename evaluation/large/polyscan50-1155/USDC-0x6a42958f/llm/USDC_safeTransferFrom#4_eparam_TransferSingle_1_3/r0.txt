The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code calls the internal `_safeTransferFrom` function, which performs the actual transfer of tokens. The `_safeTransferFrom` function checks that the `to` address is not the zero address, that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of the token type `id`, and then updates the balances accordingly.

After updating the balances, the `_safeTransferFrom` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the following arguments: `operator`, `from`, `to`, `id`, and `amount`. The `id` argument passed to the `TransferSingle` event is the same `id` that was passed to the `_safeTransferFrom` function, which represents the token type being transferred. This satisfies the given rule that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
