The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the batch transfer operation. The balances are updated correctly in the loop before the event is emitted, ensuring that the `_to` address reflects the recipient of the tokens.
