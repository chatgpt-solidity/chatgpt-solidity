The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is ensured by the following line of code within the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

Here, the `from` variable is used as the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event, which is the address from which the tokens are being transferred, thus decreasing the balance of the `from` address. The `require` statement before this ensures that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of the token type `id` to cover the `amount` being transferred:

```solidity
uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
```

This check guarantees that the `from` address is indeed the holder of the tokens before they are transferred to the `to` address. Therefore, the event is emitted according to the rule specified.
