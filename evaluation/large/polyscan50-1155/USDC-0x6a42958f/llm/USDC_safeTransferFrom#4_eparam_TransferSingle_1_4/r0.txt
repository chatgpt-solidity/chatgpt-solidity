The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the `amount` parameter being passed as the `_value` argument in the event. The `amount` represents the number of tokens to be transferred from the `from` address to the `to` address. The function checks that the `from` address has a sufficient balance (`fromBalance >= amount`) before performing the transfer, and then it decreases the balance of the `from` address by `amount` and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. This ensures that the `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event matches the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by, which complies with the given rule.
