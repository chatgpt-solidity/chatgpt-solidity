The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `_safeTransferFrom` function.

Here's the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    _balances[id][to] += amount; // Increases the balance of the recipient

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount); // Emits the event with the correct '_to' argument

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `to` parameter is used to increase the balance of the recipient (`_balances[id][to] += amount;`), and the same `to` parameter is passed as the `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event (`emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);`). This aligns with the rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
