YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the token type being transferred, which is passed to the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function as the `id` parameter. This `id` parameter is then used directly in the `emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);` statement, ensuring that the `_id` argument in the event corresponds to the token type being transferred.
