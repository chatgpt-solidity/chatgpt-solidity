The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments as specified by the rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred, and the event is emitted with the `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_ids`, and `_amounts` (referred to as `_values` in the rule) parameters, which match the required format of the event.
