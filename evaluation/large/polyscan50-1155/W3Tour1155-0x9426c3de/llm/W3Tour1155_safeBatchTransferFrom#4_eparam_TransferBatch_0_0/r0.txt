The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the account that initiated the transaction (equivalent to `msg.sender`).

Here's the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `operator` variable is assigned the value of `_msgSender()` before the `TransferBatch` event is emitted, ensuring that the `_operator` argument in the event is the address of the account that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`. This complies with the given rule.
