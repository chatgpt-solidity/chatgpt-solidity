NO

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract. According to the rule provided, the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the case of minting new tokens, there is no "from" address whose balance is decreased because new tokens are being created, not transferred from an existing holder. Therefore, the `_from` argument is set to the zero address (address(0)) to indicate that tokens are being minted, not transferred from an existing balance.

The relevant line in the `_mint` function is:
```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```

This line shows that the `_from` argument is the zero address, which is the correct and standard practice for minting events in ERC1155 tokens. The rule provided does not apply to minting events, as there is no balance decrease for any holder; instead, it applies to transfer events where tokens are moved from one holder to another.
