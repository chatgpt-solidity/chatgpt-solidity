The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the `amount` argument, which represents the number of tokens to be transferred. The function checks that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of the token type `id` before the transfer occurs. The balance of the `from` address is decreased by the `amount`, and the balance of the `to` address is increased by the same `amount`. This ensures that the `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event matches the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by, as per the given rule.
