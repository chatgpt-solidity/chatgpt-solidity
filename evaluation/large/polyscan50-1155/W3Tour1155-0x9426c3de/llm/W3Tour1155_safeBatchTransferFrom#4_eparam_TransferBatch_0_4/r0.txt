The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and must match what the recipient's balance is increased by. The event `TransferBatch` is emitted with the `_values` argument being the `amounts` array, which represents the number of tokens transferred for each token ID in the `ids` array.

The relevant part of the code that ensures this behavior is as follows:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}

emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

In the loop, the contract checks that the `from` address has enough balance of each token (`id`) to transfer the specified `amount`. It then decreases the balance of the `from` address and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the operator, from and to addresses, the list of token IDs (`ids`), and the corresponding list of amounts (`amounts`) that were transferred, which complies with the rule provided.
