YES

The function `_safeBatchTransferFrom` emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator` argument set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function, as defined in the `Context` contract, returns `msg.sender`, which is the address of the entity that called the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function includes a requirement that ensures the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or an approved operator for the owner:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

This requirement guarantees that the `_operator` (which is set to `_msgSender()`) is indeed an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, as per the given rule. Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the rule specified.
