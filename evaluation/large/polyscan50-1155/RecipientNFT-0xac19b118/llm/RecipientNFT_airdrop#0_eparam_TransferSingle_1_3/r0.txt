YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_id` argument is indeed the token type being transferred, as it is passed to the `_mint` function and used in the `emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);` line, which is consistent with the rule that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred. The `_mint` function is called within the `airdrop` function for each recipient that is not a contract, and the `TransferSingle` event is emitted accordingly.
