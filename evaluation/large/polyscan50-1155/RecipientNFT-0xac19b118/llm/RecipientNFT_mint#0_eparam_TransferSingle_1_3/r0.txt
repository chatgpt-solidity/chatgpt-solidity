The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_id` argument is indeed the token type being transferred, as specified by the `id` parameter of the `_mint` function. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `operator` (which is the message sender), `from` address (which is zero since it's a mint operation), `to` address, `id` of the token, and `amount` of the tokens being minted.
