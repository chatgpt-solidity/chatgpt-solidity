The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments. The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to `amount`, which is the number of tokens that are being minted and assigned to the `to` address. The balance of the `to` address is increased by `amount` as indicated by the line `_balances[id][to] += amount;`, which matches the `_value` argument in the event emission. Therefore, the rule is followed correctly.
