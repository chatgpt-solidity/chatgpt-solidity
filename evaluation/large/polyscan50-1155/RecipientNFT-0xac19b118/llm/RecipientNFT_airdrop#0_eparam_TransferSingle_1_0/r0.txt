The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is called by the `airdrop` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract, which is derived from `ERC1155`.

The `_mint` function sets the `operator` to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. This is in accordance with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the `operator` as the `_operator` argument, the `address(0)` as the `_from` argument (indicating minting), the `to` address as the `_to` argument, the `id` as the `_id` argument, and the `amount` as the `_value` argument.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
