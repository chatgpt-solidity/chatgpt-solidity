The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the `amount` parameter being passed as the `_value` argument to the event. The `amount` represents the number of tokens to be transferred from the `from` address to the `to` address. The function checks that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of the token type `id` before the transfer, and the balance of the `from` address is decreased by `amount` while the balance of the `to` address is increased by the same `amount`. This ensures that the `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event matches the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by, which complies with the given rule.
