YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the event is the `to` parameter of the `_mint` function, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `amount` of tokens of type `id`. The event is emitted after the recipient's balance is updated with `_balances[id][to] += amount;`, ensuring that the balance is increased before the event is emitted.
