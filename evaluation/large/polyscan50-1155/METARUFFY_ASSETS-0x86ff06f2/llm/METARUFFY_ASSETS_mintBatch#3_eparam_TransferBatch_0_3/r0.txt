The `mintBatch` function in the `METARUFFY_ASSETS` contract calls the `_mintBatch` function, which is responsible for minting a batch of tokens. The `_mintBatch` function, in turn, calls the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook and then performs the minting operation by updating the balances of the tokens for the recipient address `to`.

After updating the balances, the `_mintBatch` function emits the `TransferBatch` event with the following arguments:

- `operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred, which is the zero address (`address(0)`) since tokens are being minted.
- `to`: The recipient address to which the tokens are being minted.
- `ids`: The list of token IDs being minted.
- `amounts`: The corresponding list of amounts for each token ID being minted.

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `_ids` argument being the list of tokens being transferred (minted in this case), which complies with the given rule. Therefore, the event `TransferBatch` is emitted according to the rule specified.
