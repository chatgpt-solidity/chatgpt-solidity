The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the `amount` variable, which represents the number of tokens to be transferred. The balance of the `from` address is decreased by this `amount`, and the balance of the `to` address is increased by the same `amount`, ensuring that the value transferred matches the change in balances of both the sender and the recipient.

Here's the relevant part of the code that confirms this behavior:

```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `require` statement ensures that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of tokens of type `id` before proceeding with the transfer. The balance of the `from` address is then decreased by `amount`, and the balance of the `to` address is increased by the same `amount`. Finally, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `amount` as the `_value` argument, which matches the change in balances.
