NO

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_burn` function with the `to` argument set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which indicates that tokens are being burned (removed from circulation). The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, but in the case of burning tokens, there is no recipient whose balance is increased; instead, the balance is decreased as the tokens are destroyed. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event does not follow the given rule when it is emitted during the burning process.
