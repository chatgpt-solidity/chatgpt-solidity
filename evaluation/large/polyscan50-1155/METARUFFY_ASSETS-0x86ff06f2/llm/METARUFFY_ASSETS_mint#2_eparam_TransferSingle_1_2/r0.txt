The `mint` function in the `METARUFFY_ASSETS` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract, which is responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to the recipient address `to`. The `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_to` argument set to the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as per the rule provided.

Here's the relevant part of the `_mint` function that shows the `TransferSingle` event being emitted with the correct `_to` argument:

```solidity
function _mint(
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender();

    _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, _asSingletonArray(id), _asSingletonArray(amount), data);

    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
}
```

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred, which is `address(0)` because tokens are being minted.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are transferred, which is the `to` parameter of the `_mint` function.
- `_id`: The token ID.
- `_value`: The amount of tokens being minted.

This matches the rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
