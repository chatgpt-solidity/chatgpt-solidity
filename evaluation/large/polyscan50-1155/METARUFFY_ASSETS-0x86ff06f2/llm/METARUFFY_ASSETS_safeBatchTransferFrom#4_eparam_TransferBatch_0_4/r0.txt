The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_values` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is indeed the list of numbers of tokens that the holder's balance is decreased by, and it matches what the recipient's balance is increased by.

Here's the relevant part of the code that ensures this:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}

emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

In the loop, the contract iterates over the `ids` and `amounts` arrays, updating the balances of the `from` and `to` addresses accordingly. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `ids` and `amounts` (referred to as `_values` in the event definition), which represent the token types and the number of tokens transferred, respectively. This matches the rule that the `_values` argument must be the list of numbers of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by.
