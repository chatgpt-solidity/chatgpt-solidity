The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_operator` argument set to the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here's the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: caller is not owner nor approved"
    );
    _safeTransferFrom(from, to, id, amount, data);
}

function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted for brevity)
    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (omitted for brevity)

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);

    // ... (omitted for brevity)
}
```

In the `safeTransferFrom` function, it checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the tokens (`from`) or is an approved operator for the owner's account. If this check passes, it calls the internal `_safeTransferFrom` function.

Inside `_safeTransferFrom`, the `operator` is set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction. This `operator` is then used as the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event, satisfying the given rule.
