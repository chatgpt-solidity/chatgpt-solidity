The `burnBatch` function in the `ERC1155Burnable` contract calls the `_burnBatch` internal function, which in turn calls the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook and then proceeds to burn the tokens by reducing the balances and emitting the `TransferBatch` event.

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct arguments, including the `_ids` parameter which represents the list of token IDs being burned (transferred from the `_from` address to the zero address, which signifies a burn operation). The `_values` parameter represents the corresponding amounts of each token ID being burned.

The event signature matches the rule provided:
```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, address(0), ids, amounts);
```
Here, `ids` is the list of tokens being transferred (burned), and `amounts` is the list of quantities for each token ID, which aligns with the rule that `_ids` must be the list of tokens being transferred.
