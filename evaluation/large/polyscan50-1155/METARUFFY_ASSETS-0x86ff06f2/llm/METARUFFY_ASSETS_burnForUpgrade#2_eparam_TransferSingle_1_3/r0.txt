YES

The `burnForUpgrade` function in the `METARUFFY_ASSETS` contract calls the `_burn` function from the `ERC1155` contract. The `_burn` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct arguments, including the `_id` argument which represents the token type being transferred (burned in this case). The `_to` argument is the zero address, which is consistent with the burning operation. The rule is satisfied as the `_id` argument is indeed the token type being transferred.
