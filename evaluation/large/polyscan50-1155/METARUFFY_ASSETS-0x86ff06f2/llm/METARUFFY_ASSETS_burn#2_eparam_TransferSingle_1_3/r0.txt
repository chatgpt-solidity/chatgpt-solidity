The `_burn` function within the `ERC1155` contract takes an `id` argument which represents the token type being burned. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the same `id` argument passed to the `_burn` function, satisfying the rule that "_id argument MUST be the token type being transferred."

The `burn` function in the `ERC1155Burnable` contract calls `_burn` with the `id` and `value` provided by the caller, which then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct `_id` and `_value` as required by the rule.
