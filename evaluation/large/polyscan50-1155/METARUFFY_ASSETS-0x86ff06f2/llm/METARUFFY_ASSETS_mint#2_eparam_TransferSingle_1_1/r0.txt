The `mint` function in the `METARUFFY_ASSETS` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to the `to` address. When minting new tokens, the `_from` address is set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which is the correct behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard for minting new tokens.

The `_mint` function then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_from` argument set to the zero address, the `_to` argument set to the address receiving the newly minted tokens, the `_id` argument set to the token ID, and the `_value` argument set to the amount of tokens minted.

Since the `_from` argument is the zero address when minting, which represents the creation of new tokens rather than the transfer from an existing holder, the rule is followed correctly. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_from` argument being the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, which in the case of minting is the zero address, indicating that no existing holder's balance is decreased.
