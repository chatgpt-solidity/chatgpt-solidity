The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the token type being transferred, as required by the rule.

Here's the relevant part of the code that shows the `TransferSingle` event being emitted with the correct arguments:

```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (other code)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (other code)

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);

    // ... (other code)
}
```

In the `_safeTransferFrom` function, the `id` parameter represents the token type being transferred, and it is passed directly to the `TransferSingle` event as the `_id` argument. The `amount` parameter represents the number of tokens of type `id` being transferred and is passed as the `_value` argument in the event. The `operator`, `from`, and `to` parameters are also passed to the event as `_operator`, `_from`, and `_to`, respectively. This matches the rule provided for the `TransferSingle` event.
