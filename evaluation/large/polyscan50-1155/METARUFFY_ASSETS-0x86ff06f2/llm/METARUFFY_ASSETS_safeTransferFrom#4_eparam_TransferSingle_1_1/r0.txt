The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is ensured by the following lines of code within the `_safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
unchecked {
    _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
}
_balances[id][to] += amount;

emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

The `from` variable is used as the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event, and it is the address from which the tokens are being transferred. The balance of the `from` address is checked to ensure it has enough tokens (`fromBalance >= amount`), and then the balance is decreased by the `amount` being transferred. The event is emitted after the balance update, which complies with the rule that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased.
