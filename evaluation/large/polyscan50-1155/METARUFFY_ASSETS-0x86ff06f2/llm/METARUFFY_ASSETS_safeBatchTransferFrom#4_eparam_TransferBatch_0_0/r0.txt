The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the current message sender (`msg.sender`). This is the expected behavior as per the rule, which states that the `_operator` must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, and it should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This gets the msg.sender

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts); // Emitting the event with the correct _operator

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}

function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: transfer caller is not owner nor approved"
    );
    _safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

In the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, there is a check to ensure that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the tokens (`from`) or is approved to make the transfer on behalf of the owner. If this check passes, the internal `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function is called, which eventually emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator` set to the message sender, complying with the rule.
