NO

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_burnBatch` function with the `_to` argument set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which indicates that tokens are being burned (removed from circulation). The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, but in the case of burning tokens, no recipient's balance is increased; instead, the balance is decreased as the tokens are destroyed. Therefore, the event `TransferBatch` is not emitted according to the given rule when tokens are burned.
