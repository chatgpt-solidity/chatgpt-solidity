The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code is part of a smart contract that inherits from `ERC1155`. When the `_mintBatch` function is called within `mintBatch`, it eventually triggers the `TransferBatch` event.

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_mintBatch` function with the following line of code:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts);
```

The `operator` variable is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is a function from the `Context` contract that returns `msg.sender`, the address of the entity that called the function:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
```

This means that the `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is indeed the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender` according to the rule provided. Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
