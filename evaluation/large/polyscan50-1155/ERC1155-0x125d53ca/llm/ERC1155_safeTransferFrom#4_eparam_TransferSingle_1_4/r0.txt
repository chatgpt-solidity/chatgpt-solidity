The `safeTransferFrom` function correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_value` argument in the event is the `amount` variable, which is the number of tokens transferred from the `from` address to the `to` address. The balances are updated accordingly before the event is emitted, ensuring that the `_value` represents the actual number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and matches what the recipient's balance is increased by.
