The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code emits the `TransferSingle` event within a loop that iterates over the `itemsIds` array. For each item ID, the function increments the balance of the corresponding recipient address in the `_balances` mapping and then emits the `TransferSingle` event.

The event is emitted with the following arguments:
- `_operator`: `msg.sender`, which is the address that called the `mintBatch` function.
- `_from`: `address(0)`, which represents the minting of new tokens (as tokens are being created, not transferred from an existing address).
- `_to`: `to[i]`, which is the recipient's address for the minted token.
- `_id`: `itemsIds[i]`, which is the ID of the token being minted.
- `_value`: `1`, which is the amount of the token being minted.

The rule states that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer and should be `msg.sender`. In this case, the `_operator` is indeed `msg.sender`, which is the address that initiated the transaction and is also the only one allowed to call `mintBatch` due to the `onlyOwner` modifier.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
