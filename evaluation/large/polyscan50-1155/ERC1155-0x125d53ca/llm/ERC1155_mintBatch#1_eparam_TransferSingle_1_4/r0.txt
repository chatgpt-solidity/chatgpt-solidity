The `mintBatch` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with a hardcoded value of `1` for the `_value` argument. This implies that it is always assumed that exactly one token is being minted for each `itemsIds[i]` to `to[i]`. However, the rule states that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the holder balance is increased by.

If the intention of the contract is to always mint exactly one token per ID, then the event is emitted correctly according to the rule. But if there is any possibility that a different number of tokens should be minted for any of the IDs, then the function does not adhere to the rule, as it does not take into account the actual number of tokens minted (which could be different from 1).

Since the function does not include any logic to specify a different amount for each ID and always uses `1` as the minted amount, it does not violate the rule as stated. However, it is worth noting that the function lacks flexibility to mint a different number of tokens for each ID, which might not be the desired behavior in all cases.
