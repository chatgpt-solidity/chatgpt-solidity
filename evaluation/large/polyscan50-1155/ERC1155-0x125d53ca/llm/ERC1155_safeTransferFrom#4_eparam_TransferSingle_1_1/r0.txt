The `safeTransferFrom` function correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, as required by the rule. The `_safeTransferFrom` private function, which is called by `safeTransferFrom`, performs the balance decrease and emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct arguments.
