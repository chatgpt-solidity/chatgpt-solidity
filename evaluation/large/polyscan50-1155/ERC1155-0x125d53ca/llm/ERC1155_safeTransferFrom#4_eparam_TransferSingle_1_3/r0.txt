YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the token type being transferred, as required by the rule. The event is emitted with the correct parameters, including the `_operator` (which is `msg.sender`), `_from`, `_to`, `_id` (the token type), and `_value` (the amount being transferred).
