The given Solidity function `airdrop` emits the `TransferSingle` event with a hardcoded value of `1` for the `_value` argument. However, the rule states that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and match what the recipient's balance is increased by.

The function does not show any actual transfer of tokens or balance updates. It only emits an event with a value of `1`, which does not necessarily reflect any change in balances. Without the actual transfer logic that updates the balances of the `_from` and `_to` addresses, we cannot confirm that the `_value` of `1` corresponds to the actual number of tokens transferred.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the rule, the event `TransferSingle` is not emitted according to the given rule.
