The `_mint` function in the `APE` contract calls `emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);` where `to` is the address passed to the `_mint` function. This is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the minting process, as per the rule provided. The `_from` argument is `address(0)` because minting is akin to creating tokens out of thin air, and there is no sender in this context. The `_to` argument is indeed the address of the recipient, which satisfies the rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
