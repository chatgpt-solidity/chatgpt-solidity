The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code calls the internal `_safeTransferFrom` function, which performs the actual transfer of tokens. The `_safeTransferFrom` function checks that the `to` address is not the zero address, that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of the token type `id`, and then updates the balances accordingly.

After updating the balances, the function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the following arguments:

- `operator`: The address which initiated the transfer (in this case, the `_msgSender()`).
- `from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred.
- `to`: The address to which the tokens are transferred.
- `id`: The token type that is being transferred.
- `amount`: The number of tokens of the specified type to be transferred.

The event `TransferSingle` is emitted with the `_id` argument set to the token type being transferred, which is the `id` variable in the function. This matches the rule that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted according to the given rule.
