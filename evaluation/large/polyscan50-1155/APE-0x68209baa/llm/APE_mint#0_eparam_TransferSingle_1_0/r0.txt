The `_mint` function within the `APE` contract calls the `emit TransferSingle` event with the `operator` argument set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is an internal function that returns `msg.sender`. This is in accordance with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This is effectively msg.sender
    ...
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount); // Emitting the event with the operator as msg.sender
    ...
}
```

And the `mint` function in the `APE` contract calls `_mint` with the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the owner can call this function, which means `msg.sender` will be the owner of the contract when `_mint` is called:

```solidity
function mint(address to)
    public
    onlyOwner
{
    _mint(to, _currentTokenId, 1, "");
}
```

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument set to the address that is approved to make the transfer, which is `msg.sender` in this context.
