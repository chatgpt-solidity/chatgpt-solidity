The `_mint` function in the provided `APE` contract calls the `emit TransferSingle` event with the correct `_value` argument. The `_mint` function is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id`, and assign them to `to`. In the context of the `mint` function in the `APE` contract, it calls `_mint` with the `_currentTokenId` and an `amount` of `1`.

The `_mint` function then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `amount` that was minted, which in this case is `1`. The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the `amount` variable, which is the number of tokens the holder balance is increased by, and since the tokens are being minted, it matches the number that the recipient balance is increased by.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule, where the `_value` argument matches the number of tokens the recipient balance is increased by, which is also the number of tokens minted for the recipient.
