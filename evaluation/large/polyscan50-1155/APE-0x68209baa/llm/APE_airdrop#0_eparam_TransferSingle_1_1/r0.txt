YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_from` argument is set to `address(0)` which is appropriate for minting operations, as minting can be considered as transferring tokens from the zero address to the recipient's address. The `_mint` function is called within the `airdrop` function only for addresses that are not contracts, and it correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event with `_from` being the zero address, `_to` being the recipient's address, and the `_id` and `_value` representing the token type and amount being minted.
