The `mint` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract calls the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract with the `coinbase` variable as the `_id` argument. The `_mint` function then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `id` parameter being passed as the `_id` argument in the event, which is the token type being transferred. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
