The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract is called by the `airdrop` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract. The `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event after updating the balances and performing the safe transfer acceptance check.

The `_mint` function sets the `operator` to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. This is in line with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument correctly set to the address that initiated the transaction, which is the `msg.sender` and is the expected behavior according to the given rule.
