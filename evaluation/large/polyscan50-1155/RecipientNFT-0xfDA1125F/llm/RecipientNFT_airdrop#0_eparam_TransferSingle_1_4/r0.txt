The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract is responsible for creating tokens and assigning them to a recipient address (`to`). The `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event after updating the recipient's balance with the `amount` of tokens minted.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the minting (usually the contract owner or another authorized entity).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred, which is `address(0)` in the case of minting.
- `_to`: The recipient address to which the tokens are minted.
- `_id`: The token type identifier.
- `_value`: The number of tokens that are minted and assigned to the recipient.

The rule states that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the holder's balance is increased by, which is indeed the case in the `_mint` function. The recipient's balance is increased by the `amount` specified, and the same `amount` is passed as the `_value` argument to the `TransferSingle` event.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
