The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction. This is consistent with the rule that the `_operator` must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function calls `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, which then emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator` set to the result of `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function is a part of the `Context` contract and is designed to return the `msg.sender` of the transaction, which is the address that initiated the transaction and is expected to be approved to make the transfer.
