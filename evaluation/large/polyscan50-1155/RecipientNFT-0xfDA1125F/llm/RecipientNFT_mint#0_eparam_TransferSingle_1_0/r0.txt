YES

The `_mint` function in the provided contract code emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_operator` argument set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is an internal function that returns `msg.sender`. This is consistent with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This is effectively msg.sender
    // ...
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount); // Emitting the event with the operator as msg.sender
    // ...
}
```

The `mint` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract calls `_mint` and is restricted to the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the owner of the contract can call it. However, this does not change the fact that the `_operator` in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address that initiated the transaction (`msg.sender`), which complies with the given rule.
