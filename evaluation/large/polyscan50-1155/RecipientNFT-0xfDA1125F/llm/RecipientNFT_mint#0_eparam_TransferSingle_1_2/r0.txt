The provided Solidity function `_mint` within the `ERC1155` contract correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the `to` parameter of the `_mint` function, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `amount` of tokens of type `id`. The event is emitted after the recipient's balance is updated with the new token amount, ensuring that the `_to` argument reflects the address whose balance has been increased.
