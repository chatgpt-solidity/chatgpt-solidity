The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments. The `_value` argument in the event is the `amount` variable, which is the number of tokens to be transferred. The function ensures that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of tokens of type `id` by at least `amount` before the transfer occurs. The balance of the `from` address is decreased by `amount`, and the balance of the `to` address is increased by the same `amount`. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
unchecked {
    _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
}
_balances[id][to] += amount;

emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

The `unchecked` block is used to prevent overflow checks, which is safe here because the `require` statement ensures that `fromBalance` is greater than or equal to `amount`. The `emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);` line correctly emits the event with the `amount` as the `_value`, satisfying the given rule.
