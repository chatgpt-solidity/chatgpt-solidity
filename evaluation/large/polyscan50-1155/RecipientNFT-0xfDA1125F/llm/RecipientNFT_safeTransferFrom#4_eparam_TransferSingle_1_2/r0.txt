The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `_to` argument which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The event is emitted after the balance update and before the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, which ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the tokens (if it's a contract). The event signature matches the rule provided:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

Here, `to` is the recipient's address, `id` is the token ID, and `amount` is the value of tokens to be transferred. The `operator` is the address that initiated the transfer (which could be the owner or an approved operator), and `from` is the address from which the tokens are being transferred.
