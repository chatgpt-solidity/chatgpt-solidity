The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the `id` parameter of the `_safeTransferFrom` function, which represents the token type being transferred. The event is emitted just after the token balance is updated and before the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, ensuring that the event reflects the transfer that has just occurred.
