NO

The `Airdrop` function is emitting the `TransferSingle` event with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument, which implies that the tokens are being minted to the `to[i]` address. The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the context of an airdrop, there is typically no balance decrease from a holder; instead, tokens are being granted to recipients, often considered as being minted.

If the tokens are indeed being minted, then using `address(0)` is appropriate to signify that new tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder. If the tokens are supposed to be transferred from a specific holder's balance, then the contract should decrease the balance of that holder and use their address as the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event. Since the provided code does not show a balance decrease from a specific holder, it does not strictly follow the given rule.
