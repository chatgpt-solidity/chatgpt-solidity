The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the `amount` argument, which represents the number of tokens to be transferred. The function checks that the `from` address has a sufficient balance before performing the transfer, and then it decreases the balance of the `from` address by `amount` and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. This ensures that the `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event (which is the `amount` variable) matches the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and also matches what the recipient's balance is increased by, in accordance with the given rule.
