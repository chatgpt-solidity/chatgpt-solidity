YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner or approved operator before calling `_safeTransferFrom`. Inside `_safeTransferFrom`, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `msg.sender` as the `_operator` argument, which is the correct behavior according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`. The code follows this rule by using `msg.sender` as the `_operator` when emitting the `TransferSingle` event.
