NO

The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burnBatch` function, the `_to` argument is set to `address(0)` which indicates that tokens are being burned (removed from circulation), not transferred to a recipient whose balance should be increased.

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_to` argument, which is correct for a burn operation but does not follow the rule provided for a standard transfer where the balance of the recipient is increased. The rule does not apply to burn operations, so the event is emitted correctly according to the ERC-1155 standard for a burn operation, but not according to the given rule for balance increase.
