The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_burn` function with the correct arguments according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is the address from which the tokens are being burned, and the balance of `_from` is decreased by the `amount` of tokens of token type `id`. The `_to` argument is the zero address, indicating a burn operation. The `_operator` argument is the address that initiated the burn operation, which is obtained by calling `_msgSender()`. The `_id` and `_value` arguments correspond to the token type and the amount being burned, respectively.
