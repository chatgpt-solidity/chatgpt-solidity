YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `_id` argument which represents the token type being transferred. The event is emitted after the token balance update and before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook and the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function are called. The `_id` argument passed to the event is the same as the `id` argument received by the `_safeTransferFrom` function, which is the token type being transferred.
