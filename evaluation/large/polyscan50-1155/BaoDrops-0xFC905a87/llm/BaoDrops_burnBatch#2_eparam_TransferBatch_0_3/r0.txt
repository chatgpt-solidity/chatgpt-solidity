YES

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_burnBatch` function according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred (burned in this case), and the `_values` argument is the corresponding list of amounts for each token ID. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and just before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook is called, which is the correct behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard for batch transfers.
