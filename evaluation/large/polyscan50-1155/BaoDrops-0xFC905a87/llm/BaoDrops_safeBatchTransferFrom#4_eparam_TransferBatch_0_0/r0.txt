YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the tokens (`from`) or an approved operator for the owner's account. This is done by the `require` statement:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: transfer caller is not owner nor approved"
);
```

If the caller is not the owner, the function checks if the caller is an approved operator by calling `isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender())`.

Later in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument being the address of the caller (`msg.sender`):

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
...
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

Since the `_msgSender()` (which is a wrapper for `msg.sender` in the `Context` contract) is used as the `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, and the function ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator, the event is emitted according to the given rule.
