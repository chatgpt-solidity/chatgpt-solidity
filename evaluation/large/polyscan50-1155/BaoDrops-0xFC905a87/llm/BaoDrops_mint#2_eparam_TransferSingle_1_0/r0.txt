YES

The `mint` function in the provided contract code calls the `_mint` internal function, which emits the `TransferSingle` event. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. This means that the `_operator` is indeed the account that is making the transfer, as it is the one calling the `mint` function, which is restricted to the contract owner by the `onlyOwner` modifier.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument set to the address that initiated the transaction, which complies with the given rule.
