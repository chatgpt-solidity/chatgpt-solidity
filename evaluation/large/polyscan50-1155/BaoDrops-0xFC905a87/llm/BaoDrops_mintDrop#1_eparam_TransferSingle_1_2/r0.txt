The `mintDrop` function in the `BaoDrops` contract calls the `_mint` function for each address in the `_toAddresses` array, passing the `_tokenId` and an amount of `1` for each minting operation. The `_mint` function, as defined in the `ERC1155` contract, emits a `TransferSingle` event with the `_to` argument set to the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This is in accordance with the given rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
