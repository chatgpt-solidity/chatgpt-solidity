The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook is called. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, as required by the rule. The function checks that the `from` address has enough balance for each token id in the `ids` array before performing the transfer and updating the balances. After the balances are updated, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct `_from` address.
