The `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule. The `_burnBatch` function takes the `from` address as an argument, which is the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This `from` address is then passed to the `TransferBatch` event as the `_from` argument, which is consistent with the rule that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. The `TransferBatch` event is emitted after the balances have been decreased, which is the correct behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard for a burn operation.
