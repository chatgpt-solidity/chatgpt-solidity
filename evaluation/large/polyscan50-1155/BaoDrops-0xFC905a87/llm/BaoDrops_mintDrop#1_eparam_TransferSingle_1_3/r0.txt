The `mintDrop` function in the `BaoDrops` contract calls the `_mint` function, which is defined in the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is responsible for creating `amount` tokens of token type `id` and assigning them to the `to` address. As per the requirements in the `_mint` function, it emits a `TransferSingle` event.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:
- `operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred, which is set to the zero address (`address(0)`) to indicate minting.
- `to`: The address to which the tokens are being minted.
- `id`: The token type that is being transferred.
- `amount`: The number of tokens of the specified token type that are being transferred.

The rule states that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred, and in the context of the `mintDrop` function, this is indeed the case. The `mintDrop` function takes a `_tokenId` argument, which is passed to the `_mint` function as the `id` parameter. This `id` is then used as the `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event, satisfying the rule.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
