YES

The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_operator` argument set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction. This is in accordance with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This is the msg.sender
    ...
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount); // Emitting the event with the operator as msg.sender
    ...
}
```

The `mint` function in the `LIDO` contract, which inherits from `ERC1155`, calls `_mint` and thus will emit the `TransferSingle` event with the correct `_operator` argument when it is called.
