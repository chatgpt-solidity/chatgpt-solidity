The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must match the list and order of tokens specified in `_ids` and reflect the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by, which should also match the increase in the recipient's balance.

In the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function, which is called by `safeBatchTransferFrom`, there is a loop that iterates over the `ids` and `amounts` arrays:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}
```

This loop ensures that for each token ID (`id`) in the `ids` array, the corresponding amount (`amount`) in the `amounts` array is subtracted from the sender's (`from`) balance and added to the recipient's (`to`) balance.

After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the operator, from, to, ids, and amounts:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `ids` and `amounts` arrays are used as the `_ids` and `_values` arguments in the event, respectively, and they reflect the changes in balances as required by the rule. Therefore, the event is emitted correctly according to the rule provided.
