The function `_safeTransferFrom` emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator` variable as the first argument. The `operator` variable is assigned the value of `_msgSender()` earlier in the function, which represents the address of the entity that initiated the transaction (typically `msg.sender`). This is in line with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer and should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ...
    address operator = _msgSender();
    // ...
    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
    // ...
}
```

The `safeTransferFrom` public function calls `_safeTransferFrom` after checking that the caller is either the token owner or an approved operator, which ensures that the `operator` is indeed authorized to make the transfer:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
    );
    _safeTransferFrom(from, to, id, amount, data);
}
```

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
