The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred, and the event `TransferBatch` is emitted with the `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_ids`, and `_values` (amounts) as specified in the rule.

The relevant part of the code is:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This line is within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` public function. The `ids` array represents the list of token IDs being transferred, and the `amounts` array represents the corresponding amounts for each token ID. The `operator` is the address that initiated the transfer (equivalent to `_msgSender()`), `from` is the source address, and `to` is the destination address. These parameters match the rule for the `TransferBatch` event.
