The `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` public function, emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator` argument set to `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function returns the `msg.sender`, which is the address of the account/contract that initiated the transaction. This is in line with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, and it should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
    );
    _safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, amounts, data);
}

function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted for brevity)
    address operator = _msgSender();
    // ... (omitted for brevity)
    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
    // ... (omitted for brevity)
}
```

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function checks that the caller (`_msgSender()`) is either the token owner or an approved operator before proceeding to call `_safeBatchTransferFrom`. Inside `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator` set to `_msgSender()`, which is the correct implementation according to the given rule.
