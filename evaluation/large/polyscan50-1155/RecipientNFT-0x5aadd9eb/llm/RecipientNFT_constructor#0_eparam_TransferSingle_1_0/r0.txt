The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract is the one responsible for emitting the `TransferSingle` event. The `_mint` function is called within the constructor of the `RecipientNFT` contract, which inherits from `ERC1155`.

In the `_mint` function, the `operator` is set to `_msgSender()`, which is a function that returns `msg.sender`, the address that initiated the transaction. This is in line with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the `operator` as the `_operator` argument, satisfying the given rule. The event is emitted after the token balance is updated and before any potential safe transfer checks are performed on the recipient address.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
