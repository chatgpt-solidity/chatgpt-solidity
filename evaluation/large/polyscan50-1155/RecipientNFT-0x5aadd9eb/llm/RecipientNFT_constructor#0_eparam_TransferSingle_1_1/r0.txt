NO

The provided Solidity code defines an ERC1155 token contract and a derived contract named `RecipientNFT`. The ERC1155 contract includes an event `TransferSingle` which is emitted in the `_mint` function. The `_mint` function is called within the constructor of `RecipientNFT`.

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. In the context of minting new tokens, there is no holder from whom the tokens are being transferred, as new tokens are being created. Therefore, the `_from` argument is set to the zero address (`address(0)`) to indicate that the tokens are minted, not transferred from an existing holder.

In the `_mint` function, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```

This is the correct and expected behavior for a minting operation according to the ERC1155 standard. The rule provided does not apply to minting operations, only to transfer operations where there is an actual decrease in the balance of the `_from` address. Since the `TransferSingle` event in the context of the `_mint` function is used to signal the creation of new tokens, it does not violate the given rule.
