The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by, and it must match what the recipient's balance is increased by. This is consistent with the behavior of the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function, which performs the balance updates and emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `ids` and `amounts` arrays.

The relevant part of the code is as follows:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}

emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

In this loop, the contract checks that the `from` address has enough balance of each token (`id`) to transfer the specified `amount`. It then decreases the balance of the `from` address by the `amount` and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, and `amounts` (which are the `_values` as per the rule) as arguments. This ensures that the event reflects the actual changes in balances for each token id specified in the `ids` array.
