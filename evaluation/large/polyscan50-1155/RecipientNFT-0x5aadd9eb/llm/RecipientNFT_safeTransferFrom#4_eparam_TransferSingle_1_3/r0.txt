The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument passed to the `TransferSingle` event is obtained from the `id` parameter of the `_safeTransferFrom` function, which is called by `safeTransferFrom`. This `id` represents the token type being transferred, as required by the rule. The event is emitted with the correct arguments, including the `_operator` (the message sender or approved operator), `_from` (the address from which tokens are being transferred), `_to` (the address to which tokens are being transferred), `_id` (the token type), and `_value` (the amount of tokens being transferred).
