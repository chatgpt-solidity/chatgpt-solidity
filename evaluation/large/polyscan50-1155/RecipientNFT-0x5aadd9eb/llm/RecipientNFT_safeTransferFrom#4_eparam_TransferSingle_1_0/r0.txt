YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks whether the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the token or an approved operator for the owner. This is done by the `require` statement that checks the condition `from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender())`. If this condition is not met, the transaction will revert.

If the caller passes this check, the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function is called, which performs the actual transfer. Within `_safeTransferFrom`, the `operator` is set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which is the address that initiated the transaction (and has already been verified as the owner or an approved operator).

Finally, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `operator` argument being the address that was verified earlier (`_msgSender()`), which complies with the given rule that "_operator argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender)".

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
