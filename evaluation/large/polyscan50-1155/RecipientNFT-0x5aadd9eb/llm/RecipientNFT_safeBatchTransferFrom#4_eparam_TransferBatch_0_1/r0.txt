The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, as required by the rule.

Here's the relevant part of the code that shows the event being emitted with the correct arguments:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (other code for checks and balance updates)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ...

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ...
}
```

The `from` parameter is used throughout the function to decrease the balance of the token holder, and the same `from` address is passed to the `TransferBatch` event, satisfying the rule that "_The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased._"
