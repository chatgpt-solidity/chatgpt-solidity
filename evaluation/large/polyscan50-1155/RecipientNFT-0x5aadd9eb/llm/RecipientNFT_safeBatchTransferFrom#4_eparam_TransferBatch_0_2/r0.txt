The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and before the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called. The `_to` argument in the event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule.
