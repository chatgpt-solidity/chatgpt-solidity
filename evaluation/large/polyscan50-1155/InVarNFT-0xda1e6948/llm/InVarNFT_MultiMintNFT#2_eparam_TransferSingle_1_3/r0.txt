YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted within the `_mint` function, which is called by the `MultiMintNFT` function in a loop from `startId` to `endId`. The `_mint` function is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id` and assign them to `account`, and it emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct arguments, including the token type `id` being transferred.

The `_mint` function is called with the `id` argument set to the current token type `i` in the loop, which satisfies the rule that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred. The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the `_id` parameter set to this `id`, which is the correct token type.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
