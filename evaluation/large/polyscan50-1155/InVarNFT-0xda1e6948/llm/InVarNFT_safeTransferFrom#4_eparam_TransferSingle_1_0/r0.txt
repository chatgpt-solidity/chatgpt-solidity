The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the result of the `_msgSender()` function, which returns `msg.sender`. This is consistent with the rule that the `_operator` must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (other code)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (other code)

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);

    // ... (other code)
}
```

The `safeTransferFrom` function calls `_safeTransferFrom`, which then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator` set to the value returned by `_msgSender()`. This satisfies the rule provided.
