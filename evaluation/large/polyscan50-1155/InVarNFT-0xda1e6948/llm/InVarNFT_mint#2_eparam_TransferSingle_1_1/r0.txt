NO

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the context of minting new tokens, there is no "from" address whose balance is being decreased because new tokens are being created, not transferred from an existing holder.

In the provided `_mint` function, the `emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), account, id, amount);` line correctly uses the zero address (`address(0)`) as the `_from` argument to indicate that tokens are being minted, not transferred from another address. This is the standard way to represent minting in ERC-1155 token contracts, as per the ERC-1155 standard.

Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted correctly according to the standard practice for minting operations, even though it does not decrease the balance of an existing holder. The rule provided does not apply to minting operations, only to transfer operations.
