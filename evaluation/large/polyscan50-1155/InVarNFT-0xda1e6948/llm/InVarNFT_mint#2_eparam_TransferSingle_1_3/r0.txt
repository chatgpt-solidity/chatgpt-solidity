The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id`, and assign them to `account`. The function emits a `TransferSingle` event with the appropriate arguments, including the `_id` argument which represents the token type being transferred.

The `mint` function in the `InVarNFT` contract calls the `_mint` function from the `ERC1155` contract, passing through the `account`, `id`, and `amount` parameters, and an empty string for `data`. The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted within the `_mint` function with the `id` parameter as the `_id` argument, satisfying the given rule.
