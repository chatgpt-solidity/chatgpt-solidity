The `_mint` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to `amount`, which is the number of tokens that are being minted and assigned to the `account`. The `_balances` mapping is updated to increase the balance of `account` by `amount` for the token type `id` before the event is emitted, ensuring that the `_value` argument matches the number of tokens the recipient's balance is increased by.

Here is the relevant part of the `_mint` function:

```solidity
_balances[id][account] += amount;
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), account, id, amount);
```

The `address(0)` indicates that the tokens are being minted (created), not transferred from another account, which is consistent with the rule that the `_from` address should be zero in the case of minting. The `account` is the recipient of the minted tokens, and `amount` is the number of tokens minted, which is the value that the recipient's balance is increased by.
