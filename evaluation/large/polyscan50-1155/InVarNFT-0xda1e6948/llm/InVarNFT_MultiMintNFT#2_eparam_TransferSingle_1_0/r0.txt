The `MultiMintNFT` function in the `InVarNFT` contract calls the `_mint` function for each token ID in the range from `startId` to `endId`. The `_mint` function, as defined in the `ERC1155` contract, emits the `TransferSingle` event.

The `_mint` function sets the `operator` to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. This is in line with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument being the `msg.sender`, satisfying the given rule.
