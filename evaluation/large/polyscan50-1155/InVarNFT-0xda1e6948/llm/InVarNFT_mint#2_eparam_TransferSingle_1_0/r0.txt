The `_mint` function within the `InVarNFT` contract, which inherits from `ERC1155`, is designed to mint new tokens. According to the provided rule, the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

In the `_mint` function, the `operator` is set to `_msgSender()`, which is an internal function that returns `msg.sender`, the address of the entity that called the function. Since the `mint` function in the `InVarNFT` contract can only be called by the owner (due to the `onlyOwner` modifier), the `msg.sender` will be the owner of the contract, who is authorized to mint tokens.

The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the `operator` as the first argument, which in this case will be the owner of the contract, satisfying the rule that the `_operator` must be an approved address (the owner in this case).

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
