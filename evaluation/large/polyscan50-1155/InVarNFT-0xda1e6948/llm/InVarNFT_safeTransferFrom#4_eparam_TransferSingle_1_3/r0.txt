The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function, which is called by the `safeTransferFrom` function. The event is emitted with the correct arguments, including `_id` which represents the token type being transferred. The `_id` argument is passed directly from the `safeTransferFrom` function to the `_safeTransferFrom` function without modification, ensuring that it represents the token type being transferred as required by the rule.
