NO

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the context of minting new tokens, there is no "from" address whose balance is decreased because new tokens are being created, not transferred from an existing holder. In the `_mint` function, the `_from` argument is set to the zero address (address(0)), which is a common convention to denote minting in ERC-1155 and similar token standards.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_from` argument as the zero address, which is correct for a mint operation. The rule provided does not apply to minting operations, only to transfer operations where there is an actual "from" address whose balance of tokens is being decreased.
