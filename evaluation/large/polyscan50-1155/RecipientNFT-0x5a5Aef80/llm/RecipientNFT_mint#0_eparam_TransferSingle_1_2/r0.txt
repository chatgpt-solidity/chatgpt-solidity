The `mint` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id`, and assign them to `to`, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This is in accordance with the rule provided.

The `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_to` argument set to the `to` parameter of the `_mint` function, which is the address passed to the `mint` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract. The `_from` argument is set to the zero address, indicating that tokens are being minted (created) rather than transferred from another address.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
