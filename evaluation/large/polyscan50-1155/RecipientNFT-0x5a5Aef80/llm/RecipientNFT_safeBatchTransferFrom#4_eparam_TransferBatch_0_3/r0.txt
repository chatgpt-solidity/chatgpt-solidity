The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred, and the event is emitted with the correct parameters, including `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_ids`, and `_values` (which is named `amounts` in the function but represents the same concept).

The relevant line in the code is:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This line is called after the balances have been updated for each token ID in the `ids` array, which ensures that the event reflects the completed transfer of the batch of tokens.
