The `mint` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is responsible for creating tokens and assigning them to the `to` address. It also emits the `TransferSingle` event.

In the `_mint` function, the `operator` is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. This is the correct and expected behavior according to the rule provided, which states that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer and should be `msg.sender`.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `operator` as the `_operator` argument, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction, thus satisfying the given rule.
