The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and must match what the recipient's balance is increased by.

In the code, the `amounts` array represents the number of tokens to be transferred for each token ID in the `ids` array. The function checks that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of each token (`require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer")`) and then decreases the `from` address's balance by the specified amount while increasing the `to` address's balance by the same amount.

After updating the balances, the function emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, and `amounts` as arguments:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This event emission is in line with the rule, as the `amounts` array (referred to as `_values` in the rule) represents the number of tokens that the holder's balance is decreased by and that the recipient's balance is increased by, matching the list and order of tokens specified in the `ids` array.
