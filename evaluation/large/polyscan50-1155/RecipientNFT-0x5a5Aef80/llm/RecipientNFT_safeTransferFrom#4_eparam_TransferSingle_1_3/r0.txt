The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the token type being transferred, which is the `id` parameter of the `_safeTransferFrom` function. The `emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);` line within the `_safeTransferFrom` function ensures that the event is emitted with the correct arguments, including the token type `id`.
