YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is called within the `airdrop` function of the `RecipientNFT` contract, which is derived from `ERC1155`.

The `_mint` function sets the `operator` to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. This is in accordance with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the `operator` as the `_operator` argument, satisfying the given rule. The event is emitted after the token balance update and before the safe transfer acceptance check, which is the correct sequence for emitting such an event.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
