The `airdrop` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract calls the `_mint` function for each recipient that is not a contract (checked by the `isContract` function). The `_mint` function, in turn, emits the `TransferSingle` event with the appropriate arguments, including the `_to` argument which is set to the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This is in accordance with the given rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
