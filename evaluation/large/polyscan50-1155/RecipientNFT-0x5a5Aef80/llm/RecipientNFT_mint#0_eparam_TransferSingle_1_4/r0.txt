The provided Solidity code includes the `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract, which is responsible for minting new tokens. The `_mint` function is called by the `mint` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract, which is derived from `ERC1155` and includes the `Ownable` contract to restrict access to the owner of the contract.

The `_mint` function in `ERC1155` performs the following actions:

1. Validates that the `to` address is not the zero address.
2. Sets the `operator` to the message sender.
3. Calls `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook.
4. Increases the balance of the `to` address by the `amount` of tokens with the given `id`.
5. Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator`, `from` address (which is zero in the case of minting), `to` address, `id`, and `amount`.
6. Calls `_afterTokenTransfer` hook.
7. Performs a safe transfer acceptance check if `to` is a contract.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the transfer (in this case, the message sender).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred (in this case, the zero address, since tokens are being minted).
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are transferred.
- `_id`: The token type being transferred.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being transferred.

The rule states that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and match what the recipient's balance is increased by. In the case of minting, the `_from` address is the zero address, which means that no holder's balance is being decreased. Instead, new tokens are being created and assigned to the `to` address. The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event matches the `amount` by which the recipient's balance is increased, which is consistent with the rule for minting operations.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule when the `_mint` function is called, and the answer is "YES".
