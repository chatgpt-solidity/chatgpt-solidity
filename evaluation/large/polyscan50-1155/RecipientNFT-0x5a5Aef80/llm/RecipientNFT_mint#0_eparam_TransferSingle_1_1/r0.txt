The provided Solidity function `mint` in the `RecipientNFT` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is designed to create new tokens and assign them to the `to` address. When minting new tokens, the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the zero address (address(0)), which indicates that the tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder.

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the case of minting, there is no holder from whom the balance is decreased, as new tokens are being created. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event emitted during the minting process does not have an existing holder's address as the `_from` argument; instead, it uses the zero address.

The `TransferSingle` event in the `_mint` function is emitted with the following arguments:
```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```
Here, `address(0)` is used for the `_from` argument, which is consistent with the ERC-1155 standard for minting new tokens. Thus, the event `TransferSingle` is not emitted according to the given rule when minting, as the rule is intended for transfer scenarios, not minting.
