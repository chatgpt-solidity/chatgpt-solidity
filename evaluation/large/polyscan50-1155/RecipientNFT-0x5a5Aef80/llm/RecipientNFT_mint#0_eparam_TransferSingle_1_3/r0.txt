The `mint` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract is responsible for creating `amount` tokens of token type `id` and assigning them to the address `to`. It also emits the `TransferSingle` event.

The `_mint` function constructs the `ids` and `amounts` arrays with a single element each, corresponding to the `id` and `amount` arguments passed to the function. It then calls `_beforeTokenTransfer` and `_afterTokenTransfer` hooks, updates the balances, and finally emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct arguments, including the `_id` which represents the token type being transferred.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred, which is `address(0)` in the case of minting.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being minted.
- `_id`: The token type being transferred, which is the `id` argument passed to the `_mint` function.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being transferred, which is the `amount` argument passed to the `_mint` function.

Since the `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event corresponds to the token type being transferred, the rule is satisfied.
