The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `_to` argument which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The event is emitted after the balance update and before the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, which is consistent with the ERC-1155 standard and the given rule.
