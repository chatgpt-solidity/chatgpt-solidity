YES

The `mintErc20` function in the provided Solidity code calls the `_mint` function, which is part of the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to a recipient address (`to`). As part of the minting process, the `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event.

The `_mint` function constructs the `operator` variable by calling `_msgSender()`, which returns the `msg.sender` (the address that initiated the transaction). This `operator` is then used as the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event.

Here is the relevant part of the `_mint` function that emits the `TransferSingle` event:

```solidity
function _mint(
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender();
    uint256[] memory ids = _asSingletonArray(id);
    uint256[] memory amounts = _asSingletonArray(amount);

    _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _afterTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
}
```

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `operator` as the `_operator` argument, which is the `msg.sender` as required by the rule. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
