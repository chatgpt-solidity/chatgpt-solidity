The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is ensured by the following lines of code:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}

emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `for` loop iterates over each `id` and `amount` pair, checks that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of each token (`id`), and then decreases the balance of the `from` address by the specified `amount`. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `from` address as the second argument, which is the address of the holder whose balance was decreased.
