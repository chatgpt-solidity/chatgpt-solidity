The `adminMint` function in the provided Solidity code is responsible for minting new tokens of a specific ID to a given address. When minting new tokens, the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event should be the zero address, as new tokens are being created and not transferred from an existing holder.

In the `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `from` parameter set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which is the correct behavior for a mint operation. The `adminMint` function calls `_mint`, which in turn correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event with the zero address as the `_from` parameter.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule for minting operations, where the `_from` argument is the zero address to indicate that tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder.
