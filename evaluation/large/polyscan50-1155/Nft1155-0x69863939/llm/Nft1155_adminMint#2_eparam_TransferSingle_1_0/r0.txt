The `adminMint` function in the provided Solidity code calls the `_mint` function, which is responsible for minting new tokens. The `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event as part of its execution.

In the `_mint` function, the `operator` variable is set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which returns the address of the sender of the message (transaction), which in this case is the admin (owner of the contract) because the `adminMint` function can only be called by the owner due to the `onlyOwner` modifier.

The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the `operator` as the `_operator` argument, `address(0)` as the `_from` argument (since minting is considered a transfer from the zero address), the `to` address as the `_to` argument, the `id` of the token as the `_id` argument, and the `amount` of tokens minted as the `_value` argument.

This behavior complies with the given rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`. Since the `adminMint` function can only be called by the owner, and the owner is the `msg.sender`, the rule is satisfied.
