The `mintErc20` function in the provided Solidity code calls the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is responsible for creating `amount` tokens of token type `id` and assigning them to the address `to`. As part of its execution, the `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:
- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred, which is the zero address (`address(0)`) in the case of minting.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being minted, which is the `to` parameter passed to the `_mint` function.
- `_id`: The token type being transferred, which is the `id` parameter passed to the `_mint` function.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being transferred, which is the `amount` parameter passed to the `_mint` function.

The rule states that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred, and in this case, the `_id` argument is indeed the token type (`id`) being minted. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
