The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, as required by the rule.

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function calls the internal `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which performs the balance updates and emits the `TransferBatch` event. The `from` parameter passed to `_safeBatchTransferFrom` is used as the `_from` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, ensuring that the address whose balance is decreased is the one specified in the event emission.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
        uint256 id = ids[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
        require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
        unchecked {
            _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
        }
        _balances[id][to] += amount;
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `from` variable is used to decrease the balance of the token holder, and the same `from` variable is used as the `_from` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, which complies with the rule.
