The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the `account` parameter of the `_mint` function, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The `_mint` function is called within the `MultiMintNFT` function in a loop for each token ID from `startId` to `endId`, and each time it is called, it emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct `_to` argument as per the rule.
