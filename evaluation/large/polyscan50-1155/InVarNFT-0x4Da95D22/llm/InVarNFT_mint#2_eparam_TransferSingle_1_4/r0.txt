YES

The provided Solidity function `_mint` within the `InVarNFT` contract, which inherits from `ERC1155`, is designed to mint a specified `amount` of tokens of a given `id` to an `account`. The function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_value` argument set to the `amount` of tokens minted.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following parameters:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the minting process (in this case, the owner of the contract due to the `onlyOwner` modifier).
- `_from`: The zero address, indicating that tokens are being minted rather than transferred from an existing holder.
- `_to`: The recipient's address (`account`).
- `_id`: The token type identifier (`id`).
- `_value`: The number of tokens minted (`amount`).

The `_balances` mapping is updated to reflect the new balance for the `account` before the event is emitted, ensuring that the `_value` in the `TransferSingle` event matches the number of tokens the recipient's balance is increased by. There is no decrease in the holder's balance since minting creates new tokens.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule, and the answer is "YES".
