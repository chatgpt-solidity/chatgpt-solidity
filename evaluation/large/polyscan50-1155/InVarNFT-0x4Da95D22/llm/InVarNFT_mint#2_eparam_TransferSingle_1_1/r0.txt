The `_mint` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to create (`mint`) new tokens of a specific token type (`id`) and assign them to an `account`. According to the ERC-1155 standard, when new tokens are minted, they are considered to be transferred from the zero address (which represents the creation of new tokens).

In the `_mint` function, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_from` argument set to the zero address (`address(0)`), the `_to` argument set to the `account` to which the tokens are being minted, the `_id` argument set to the token type being minted, and the `_value` argument set to the `amount` of tokens being minted.

This behavior is consistent with the rule provided, as the `_from` argument is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreasedâ€”in this case, the zero address, which is the convention for indicating that tokens are being minted rather than transferred from an existing holder. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
