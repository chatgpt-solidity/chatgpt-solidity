The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract is called by the `MultiMintNFT` function in the `InVarNFT` contract. The `_mint` function is responsible for creating `amount` tokens of token type `id` and assigning them to `account`. As per the provided code, the `_mint` function emits a `TransferSingle` event with the following parameters:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred, which is the zero address (`address(0)`) since tokens are being minted.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being transferred, which is the `account` parameter.
- `_id`: The token type being transferred, which is the `id` parameter.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being transferred, which is the `amount` parameter.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct `_id` argument, which is the token type being transferred, as required by the given rule. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted according to the given rule.
