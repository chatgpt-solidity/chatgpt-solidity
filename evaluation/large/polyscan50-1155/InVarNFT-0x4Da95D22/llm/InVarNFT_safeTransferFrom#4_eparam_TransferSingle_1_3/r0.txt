The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the token type being transferred, as required by the rule.

The relevant part of the code is:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

This line is within the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function, which is called by the `safeTransferFrom` public function. The `id` variable represents the token type being transferred, and it is passed as the `_id` argument to the `TransferSingle` event, satisfying the rule.
