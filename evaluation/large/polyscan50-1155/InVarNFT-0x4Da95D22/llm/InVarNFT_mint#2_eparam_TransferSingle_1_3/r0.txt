YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_id` argument is indeed the token type being transferred, as it is passed to the `_mint` function and used in the `emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), account, id, amount);` line, which is consistent with the rule that `_id` must be the token type being transferred. The `_mint` function is called by the `mint` function in the `InVarNFT` contract, which is an extension of `ERC1155`.
