YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function checks if the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the tokens (`from`) or an approved operator for the owner's account. This is done by the following line:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: transfer caller is not owner nor approved"
);
```

If the check passes, the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function is called, which performs the actual transfer. Within `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, the `operator` variable is set to `_msgSender()`:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
```

This ensures that the `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is indeed the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`. The event is then emitted with the correct operator:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
