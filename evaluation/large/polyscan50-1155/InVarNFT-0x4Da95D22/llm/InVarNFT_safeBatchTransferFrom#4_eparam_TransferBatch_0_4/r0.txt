The `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by. In the provided function `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, the `amounts` array represents the number of tokens to be transferred for each token ID in the `ids` array. The balances are updated accordingly before the event is emitted:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}

emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `amounts` array is used to decrease the balance of the `from` address and increase the balance of the `to` address for each token ID. After these balance updates, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, and `amounts` as arguments, which aligns with the rule provided.
