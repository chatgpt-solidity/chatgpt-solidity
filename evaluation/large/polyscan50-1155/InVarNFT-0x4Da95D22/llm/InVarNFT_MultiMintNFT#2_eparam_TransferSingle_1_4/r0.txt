YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct `_value` argument. The `_mint` function is called within the `MultiMintNFT` function in a loop from `startId` to `endId`, and for each iteration, it mints exactly 1 token (as indicated by the third argument to `_mint`, which is `1`). The `_mint` function then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `amount` argument set to `1`, which is the number of tokens minted and assigned to the `account`. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder balance is increased by, which in this case is `1` for each minting operation.
