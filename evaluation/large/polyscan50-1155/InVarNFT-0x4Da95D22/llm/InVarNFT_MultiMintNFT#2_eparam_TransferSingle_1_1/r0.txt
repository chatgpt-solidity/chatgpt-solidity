The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the given rule. The `_from` argument is set to `address(0)` which is appropriate for minting operations, as minting can be considered as transferring tokens from the zero address to the `account` address. The `account` variable represents the holder who will receive the tokens, and the balance of `account` is increased by the `amount` of tokens minted with the token type `id`.

The `MultiMintNFT` function calls the `_mint` function in a loop from `startId` to `endId`, and for each iteration, it mints 1 token of the given `id` to the `account`. Each call to `_mint` will emit the `TransferSingle` event with `_from` as the zero address, `_to` as the `account` address, `_id` as the current token ID in the loop, and `_value` as 1 (since one token is minted each time). This behavior is consistent with the ERC-1155 standard for minting new tokens and follows the rule provided.
