YES

The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient (`account`) whose balance is increased. The `mint` function in the `InVarNFT` contract calls `_mint` with the `account` parameter, which is the recipient's address. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted within the `_mint` function with the correct arguments, including the `_to` parameter set to `account`.
