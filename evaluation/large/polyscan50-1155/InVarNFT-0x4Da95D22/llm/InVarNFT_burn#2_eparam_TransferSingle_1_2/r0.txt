The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burn` function, the `_to` argument is set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which indicates that tokens are being burned and not transferred to any recipient. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_to` argument as the zero address, which does not increase the balance of any recipient, thus not following the given rule.
