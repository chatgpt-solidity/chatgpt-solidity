YES

The provided Solidity function `safeTransferFrom` and its related part `_update` will throw if there is "any other error" that is not explicitly handled within the code. In Solidity, arithmetic operations such as subtraction and addition can cause a throw if they result in an underflow or overflow, respectively.

In the `_update` function, the line `_balances[id][from] -= value;` will throw if the balance of `from` for token `id` is less than `value`, because this would result in an underflow. Similarly, the line `_balances[id][to] += value;` could theoretically throw if the addition results in an overflow of the balance, although this is highly unlikely due to the large number space of the uint256 type.

Since the code does not include any checks to prevent underflows (e.g., using SafeMath library or require statements to ensure sufficient balance before performing the subtraction), and there are no other error handling mechanisms in place, the function will throw if an underflow occurs or any other unhandled error condition arises during execution.
