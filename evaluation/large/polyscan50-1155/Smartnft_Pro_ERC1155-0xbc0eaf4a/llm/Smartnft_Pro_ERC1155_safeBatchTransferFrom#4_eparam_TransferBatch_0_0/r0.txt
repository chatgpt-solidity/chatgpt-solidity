The `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function within the `ERC1155` contract correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `_operator` argument set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function is designed to return the address of the sender of the message (transaction), which is typically `msg.sender`. This is in line with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` public function, which is the external interface that calls `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an approved operator:

```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
    );
    _safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

This check ensures that the `_operator` (which will be `_msgSender()`) is indeed authorized to perform the batch transfer, either as the token owner or as an approved operator. Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
