The `mintBatch` function in the provided Smartnft_Pro_ERC1155 contract correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address of the recipient (`to`) whose balance is increased by the `_mintBatch` internal function.

Here's the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mintBatch(
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");
    require(ids.length == amounts.length, "ERC1155: ids and amounts length mismatch");

    address operator = _msgSender();

    _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
        _balances[ids[i]][to] += amounts[i];
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts);

    _afterTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

In the `_mintBatch` function:

- The `to` parameter is the recipient's address.
- The `ids` array contains the token IDs being minted.
- The `amounts` array contains the number of tokens being minted for each corresponding ID.
- The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator` (the sender of the message), `_from` as the zero address (indicating minting), `_to` as the recipient's address, `_ids` as the array of token IDs, and `_values` as the array of amounts.

The `mintBatch` function calls `_mintBatch`, passing `msg.sender` as the `to` address, which is the recipient of the newly minted tokens. The `TransferBatch` event is then emitted with the correct `_to` argument, satisfying the given rule.
