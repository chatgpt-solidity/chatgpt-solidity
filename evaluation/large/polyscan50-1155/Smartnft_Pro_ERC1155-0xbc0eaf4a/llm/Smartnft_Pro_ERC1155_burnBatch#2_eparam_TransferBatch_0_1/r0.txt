YES

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_burnBatch` function according to the given rule. The `_from` argument is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is ensured by the following lines in the `_burnBatch` function:

```solidity
require(from != address(0), "ERC1155: burn from the zero address");
```

This line ensures that the `_from` address is not the zero address, which is a requirement for a valid holder address.

```solidity
uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: burn amount exceeds balance");
```

These lines ensure that the holder (`_from`) has a sufficient balance of the token (`id`) before burning the specified `amount`.

Finally, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct arguments:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, address(0), ids, amounts);
```

Here, `operator` is the address performing the operation, `from` is the address of the token holder whose balance is being decreased, `address(0)` is the recipient address which, in the case of a burn operation, is the zero address, `ids` is the array of token IDs, and `amounts` is the array of amounts of tokens being burned. This matches the rule that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased.
