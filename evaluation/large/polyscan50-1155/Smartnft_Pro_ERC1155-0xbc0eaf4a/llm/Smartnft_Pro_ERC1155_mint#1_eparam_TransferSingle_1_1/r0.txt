NO

The rule states that the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the context of minting new tokens, there is no "from" address that is losing tokens, as new tokens are being created. In the `_mint` function, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument, which is a common practice to denote minting:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```

This indicates that the tokens are being minted (created) rather than transferred from an existing holder. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is not emitted according to the given rule in the context of minting, as there is no holder from whom the balance is decreased. The rule applies to transfers, not minting operations.
