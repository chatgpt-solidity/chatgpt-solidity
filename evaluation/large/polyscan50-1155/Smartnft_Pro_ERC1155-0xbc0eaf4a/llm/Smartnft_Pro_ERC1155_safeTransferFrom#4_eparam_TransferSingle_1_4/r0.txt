The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments. The `_value` argument is set to the `amount` variable, which is the number of tokens to be transferred. The function ensures that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of tokens of type `id` by at least `amount` before proceeding with the transfer. After the balance check, the function decreases the balance of the `from` address by `amount` and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by.

The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the `operator` as the `_operator`, `from` as the `_from`, `to` as the `_to`, `id` as the `_id`, and `amount` as the `_value`, which complies with the given rule.
