YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_burn` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which is called by the `burn` function of the `ERC1155Burnable` contract. The `_id` argument passed to the `TransferSingle` event is the same as the `id` argument passed to the `burn` function, which represents the token type being burned. Therefore, the rule that "_id argument MUST be the token type being transferred" is followed.
