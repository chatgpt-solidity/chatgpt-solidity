The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which returns `msg.sender`. This is the correct implementation as per the rule stating that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mint(
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This is the correct implementation as per the rule
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount); // The event is emitted correctly

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `operator` set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the standard way to retrieve `msg.sender` within the context of the current function call. Therefore, the event is emitted according to the given rule.
