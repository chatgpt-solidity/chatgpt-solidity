NO

The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burnBatch` function, the `_to` argument is set to `address(0)` which indicates that tokens are being burned (removed from circulation), not transferred to a recipient whose balance should be increased.

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_to` argument, which does not comply with the given rule that `_to` should be the address of a recipient with an increased balance. Instead, it signifies that the tokens are being burned:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, address(0), ids, amounts);
```

This is the correct behavior for a burn operation, but it does not follow the rule as stated.
