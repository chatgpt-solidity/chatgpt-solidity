The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is ensured by the following line of code within the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

Here, the `from` variable is the address from which the tokens are being transferred, and it is passed as the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event, which complies with the rule that "_The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased_". The `from` variable is used to decrease the balance of the holder by the specified `amount` of tokens of type `id` before the event is emitted.
