NO

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_burn` function with the `_to` argument set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which indicates that tokens are being burned (removed from circulation), not transferred to a recipient whose balance should be increased. The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, which is not the case when burning tokens.
