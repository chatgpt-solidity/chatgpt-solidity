YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `_id` argument which represents the token type being transferred. The event is emitted after the balance checks and updates, and before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook and the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function are called. The arguments passed to the event are consistent with the rule provided.
