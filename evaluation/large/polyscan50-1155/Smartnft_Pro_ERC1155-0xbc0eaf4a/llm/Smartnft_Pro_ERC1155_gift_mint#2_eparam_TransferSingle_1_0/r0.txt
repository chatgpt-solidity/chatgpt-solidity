The `gift_mint` function in the provided Smartnft_Pro_ERC1155 contract calls the `_mint` function of the ERC1155 base contract. The `_mint` function is designed to mint new tokens and assign them to the `to` address. According to the rule provided, the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

In the `_mint` function, the `operator` is set to `_msgSender()`, which is a function that returns `msg.sender`, the caller of the function. This means that the `operator` is indeed the address that initiated the minting process. The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the `operator` as the `_operator` argument, satisfying the rule provided.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
