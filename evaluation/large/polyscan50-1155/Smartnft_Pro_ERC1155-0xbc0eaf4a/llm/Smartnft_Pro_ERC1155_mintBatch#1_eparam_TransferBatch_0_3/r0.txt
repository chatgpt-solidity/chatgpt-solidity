YES

The `mintBatch` function in the provided Smartnft_Pro_ERC1155 contract correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred (minted in this case), and the `_values` argument is the corresponding list of amounts for each token.

Here's the relevant part of the code that shows the `TransferBatch` event being emitted with the correct arguments:

```solidity
function mintBatch( uint256[] memory amounts, string[] memory _uris )
    public payable
{
    uint256[] memory ids = new uint256[](amounts.length);
    for( uint256 i= 0; i < amounts.length; i++ ) {
        tokenCounts += 1;
       ids[i] = tokenCounts; 
       _tokenURIs[tokenCounts] = _uris[i];
    }

    _mintBatch( msg.sender, ids, amounts, "0x0" );
}

// ...

function _mintBatch(
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ...
    emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts);
    // ...
}
```

In the `mintBatch` function, a new array `ids` is created to store the token IDs for each new token being minted. The `tokenCounts` variable is incremented to generate a new token ID for each token. The `_mintBatch` internal function is then called with the `msg.sender` as the `to` address, the `ids` array as the list of new token IDs, and the `amounts` array as the list of amounts for each token.

Inside the `_mintBatch` function, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator` (which is the message sender), `address(0)` as the `_from` address (indicating minting), `to` as the recipient address, `ids` as the list of token IDs, and `amounts` as the corresponding list of amounts. This matches the rule provided for the `TransferBatch` event.
