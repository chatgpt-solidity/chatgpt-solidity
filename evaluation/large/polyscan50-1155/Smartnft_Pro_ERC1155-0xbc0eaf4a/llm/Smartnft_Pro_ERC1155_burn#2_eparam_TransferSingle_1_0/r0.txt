YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_burn` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which is called by the `burn` function of the `ERC1155Burnable` contract. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is an internal function that returns `msg.sender`, the address of the entity that called the function.

In the context of the `burn` function, `msg.sender` is the address of the account that is either the owner of the token or an approved operator, as enforced by the `require` statement at the beginning of the `burn` function. This requirement ensures that the caller is authorized to burn the tokens.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument correctly set to an approved address, satisfying the given rule.
