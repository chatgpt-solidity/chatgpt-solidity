The `mint` function in the provided Smartnft_Pro_ERC1155 contract calls the `_mint` function, which in turn emits the `TransferSingle` event. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the `to` parameter of the `_mint` function, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This is in accordance with the rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
