YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the token or an approved operator for the owner before proceeding with the transfer. This is done by the following line:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

If the check passes, the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function is called, which performs the actual transfer. Within `_safeTransferFrom`, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `operator` argument set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender`:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
...
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

Since the `operator` is set to the address of the account that passed the initial check (either the token owner or an approved operator), the rule that "_operator argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender)_" is satisfied.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
