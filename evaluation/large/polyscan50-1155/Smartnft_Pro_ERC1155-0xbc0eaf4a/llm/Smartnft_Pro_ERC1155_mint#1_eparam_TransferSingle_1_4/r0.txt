The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct `_value` argument. The `_mint` function increases the balance of the `to` address by the `amount` specified, and the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the same `amount` as the `_value`. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder balance is increased by, which in the case of minting, is the `amount` of tokens created and assigned to the `to` address.
