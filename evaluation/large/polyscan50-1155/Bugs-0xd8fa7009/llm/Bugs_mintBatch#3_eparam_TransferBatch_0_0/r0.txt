The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code calls the `_mintBatch` internal function, which is responsible for minting a batch of tokens. The `_mintBatch` function emits the `TransferBatch` event as part of its execution.

The `_mintBatch` function sets the `operator` to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is an internal function that returns `msg.sender`. This means that the `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event will be the address that initiated the transaction, which is in compliance with the given rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer and should be `msg.sender`.

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the following line of code within the `_mintBatch` function:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts);
```

Here, `operator` is set to the address of the account that called the `mintBatch` function, which is the owner of the contract due to the `onlyOwner` modifier. Since the `mintBatch` function can only be called by the owner (who is by default approved to make transfers), the rule is satisfied.
