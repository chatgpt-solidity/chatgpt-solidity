The function `_safeTransferFrom` within the `ERC1155` contract emits the `TransferSingle` event, and it does so according to the rule specified. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which returns the `msg.sender` of the transaction. This is the correct implementation as per the rule, because `msg.sender` is the address of the account/contract that initiated the transaction and is expected to be approved to make the transfer.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (other code)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (other code)

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);

    // ... (other code)
}
```

The `safeTransferFrom` public function, which is the external interface that calls `_safeTransferFrom`, checks that the caller is either the token owner or an approved operator:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
    );
    _safeTransferFrom(from, to, id, amount, data);
}
```

This ensures that the `_operator` in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed an approved entity to make the transfer, satisfying the rule provided.
