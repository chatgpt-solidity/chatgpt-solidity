YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is ensured by the following lines of code:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, from, to, ids, amounts, data);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
        uint256 id = ids[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
        require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
        unchecked {
            _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
        }
        _balances[id][to] += amount;
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

In the loop, the balance of the `_from` address is decreased by the `amount` for each `id`, and then the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `from` address as the second argument, which is the holder whose balance was decreased. This complies with the rule that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased.
