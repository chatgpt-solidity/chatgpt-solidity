YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the tokens (`from`) or is an approved operator for the owner's account. This is done by the following line:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

If this requirement is met, the function proceeds to call `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, which performs the actual transfer of tokens. Within `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, the `operator` is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
```

This `operator` is then used as the `_operator` argument when emitting the `TransferBatch` event:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

Since the `operator` is set to the value of `_msgSender()`, which has been previously checked to be the token owner or an approved operator, the rule that "_The `_operator` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender)_" is satisfied.

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
