The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the `amount` argument, which represents the number of tokens to be transferred. The function ensures that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of the token type `id` by at least the `amount` being transferred. It then decreases the balance of the `from` address by the `amount` and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. This satisfies the rule that the `_value` argument (which is `amount` in this case) must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and match what the recipient's balance is increased by.
