The `_burn` function within the `ERC1155` contract is designed to destroy a certain `amount` of tokens of a specific token type `id` from the `from` address. The function emits a `TransferSingle` event to reflect this change.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following parameters:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the burn operation (typically the message sender).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being burned.
- `_to`: The zero address, since the tokens are being destroyed and not transferred to another address.
- `_id`: The ID of the token type being burned.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being burned.

The rule states that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by, which is indeed the case in the `_burn` function. The holder's balance is decreased by the `amount` specified, and the same `amount` is passed as the `_value` in the `TransferSingle` event.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
