YES

The `mint` function in the provided contract code calls the `_mint` function, which is responsible for creating a specified amount of tokens of a given token type (`id`) and assigning them to the `to` address. The `_mint` function performs several steps, including updating the balance of the `to` address by adding the `amount` of tokens minted and emitting the `TransferSingle` event.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the minting (usually the contract owner in this case).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred, which is the zero address (`address(0)`) since tokens are being minted.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are minted.
- `_id`: The token type that is being minted.
- `_value`: The number of tokens that are being minted and assigned to the `to` address.

The rule states that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the holder's balance is increased by, which is indeed the case in the `_mint` function. The `amount` of tokens minted is both added to the recipient's balance and passed as the `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule, and the answer is "YES".
