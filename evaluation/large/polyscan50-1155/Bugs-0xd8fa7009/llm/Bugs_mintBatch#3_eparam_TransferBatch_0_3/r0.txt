The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code calls the `_mintBatch` internal function, which is responsible for minting a batch of tokens. The `_mintBatch` function ensures that the `ids` and `amounts` arrays have the same length, as required by the ERC1155 standard, and then proceeds to mint the tokens by updating the balances and emitting the `TransferBatch` event.

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct arguments, including the `_operator` (the message sender), `_from` address (which is `address(0)` since it's a mint operation), `_to` address (the recipient of the minted tokens), `_ids` (the list of token IDs being minted), and `_values` (the corresponding amounts of each token ID being minted).

The rule specified is followed correctly, as the `_ids` argument represents the list of tokens being transferred (in this case, minted), and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with these IDs and their corresponding values.
