The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_mintBatch` internal function is called within `mintBatch`, and it is responsible for performing the actual minting of tokens in batches.

Here's the sequence of operations that ensure the rule is followed:

1. The `_mintBatch` function checks that the `to` address is not zero and that the `ids` and `amounts` arrays have the same length, which is required for the batch operation.

2. The `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook is called, which in turn calls the overridden function from the parent contract if any. This is a placeholder for any additional logic that needs to be executed before the token transfer.

3. The for loop within `_mintBatch` increments the balance of the `to` address for each token ID by the corresponding amount specified in the `amounts` array.

4. The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator` (the message sender), the `from` address (which is zero since it's a mint operation), the `to` address, the `ids` array, and the `amounts` array. The `amounts` array represents the number of tokens minted for each token ID, which matches the rule that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder balance is increased by.

5. The `_afterTokenTransfer` hook is called, which is another placeholder for additional logic that can be executed after the token transfer.

6. The `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called to ensure that if the `to` address is a contract, it properly implements the `IERC1155Receiver` interface and accepts the token batch.

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct values, ensuring that the `_values` argument matches the number of tokens minted for each token ID in the `ids` array, thus adhering to the rule specified.
