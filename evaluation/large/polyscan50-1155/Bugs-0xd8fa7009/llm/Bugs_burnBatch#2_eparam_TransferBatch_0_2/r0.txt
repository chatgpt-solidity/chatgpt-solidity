The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burnBatch` function, the `_to` argument is set to the zero address (address(0)), which indicates that tokens are being burned rather than transferred to a recipient. The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `_to` argument as the zero address, which does not increase the balance of any recipient but rather decreases the balance of the `_from` address as the tokens are being burned. Therefore, the event `TransferBatch` is not emitted according to the given rule.
