The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `_id` argument which represents the token type being transferred. The event is emitted just after the balances are updated and before the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, which is consistent with the rule provided.
