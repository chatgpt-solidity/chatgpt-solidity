The `mintBatch` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument. According to the ERC-1155 standard, when minting new tokens, the `_from` argument should be `address(0)` to indicate that the tokens are being created, not transferred from an existing holder. The rule provided states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, which is not applicable in the case of minting new tokens. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted correctly according to the standard for minting operations, but it does not follow the given rule because the rule does not apply to minting scenarios.
