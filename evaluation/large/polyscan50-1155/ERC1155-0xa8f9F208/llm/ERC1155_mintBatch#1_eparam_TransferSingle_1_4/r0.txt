The `mintBatch` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with a hardcoded `_value` of 1. However, the rule states that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the recipient balance is increased by. Since the function does not take into account the actual number of tokens being minted for each `itemsIds[i]` and simply increments the balance by 1, it does not necessarily follow the rule if the intention was to mint a different number of tokens for each item ID.

If the contract is designed to always mint exactly one token per item ID, then the hardcoded value of 1 would be correct. However, the function signature and the rule provided do not specify this constraint, so based on the information given, we cannot assume that minting exactly one token per item ID is always the case. Therefore, the event may not be emitted according to the given rule in all scenarios.
