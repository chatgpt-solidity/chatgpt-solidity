The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, as required by the rule. The function decreases the balance of `_from` by `amount` before emitting the event, ensuring that the `_from` argument represents the address of the holder whose balance is being decreased.
