YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner (`from`) or an approved operator for the `from` address before proceeding with the transfer. This is done by the `require` statement:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

If the caller is not the token owner, the function checks if the caller is approved for all by calling `isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender())`.

After this check, the function calls `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, which performs the actual transfer and emits the `TransferBatch` event:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `operator` variable is set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which returns `msg.sender`:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
```

Since the `operator` is set to `msg.sender` and the `msg.sender` must be an approved operator or the token owner (as enforced by the `require` statement), the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument being the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which complies with the given rule.
