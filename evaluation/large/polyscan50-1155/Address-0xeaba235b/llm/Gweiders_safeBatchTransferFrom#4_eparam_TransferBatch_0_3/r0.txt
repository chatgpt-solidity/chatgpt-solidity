The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred, and the event is emitted with the appropriate parameters, including `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_ids`, and `_values` (which corresponds to `amounts` in the function).

The relevant part of the code is:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This line is within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` public function. The `ids` array represents the list of token IDs being transferred, and the `amounts` array represents the corresponding list of amounts for each token ID. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and before the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, which ensures that the `to` address (if it's a contract) properly implements the `IERC1155Receiver` interface.
