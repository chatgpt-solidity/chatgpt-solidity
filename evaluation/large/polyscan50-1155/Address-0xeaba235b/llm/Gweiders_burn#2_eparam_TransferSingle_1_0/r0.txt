YES

The `_burn` function within the `ERC1155Burnable` contract correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_operator` argument being the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction. This is in accordance with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

The `burn` function in the `ERC1155Burnable` contract checks that the `msg.sender` is either the owner of the tokens or an approved operator for the owner's account before calling `_burn`. The `_burn` function then uses `_msgSender()` to get the `msg.sender` and passes it as the `operator` to the `TransferSingle` event. This ensures that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct `_operator` argument.
