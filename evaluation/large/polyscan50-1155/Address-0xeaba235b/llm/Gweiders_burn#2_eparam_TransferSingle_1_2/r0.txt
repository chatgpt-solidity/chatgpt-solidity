The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burn` function, the `_to` argument is set to `address(0)` which represents the burn operation (i.e., the tokens are being destroyed, not transferred to another recipient). Therefore, the balance of the `_to` address is not increased; instead, the tokens are effectively removed from circulation.
