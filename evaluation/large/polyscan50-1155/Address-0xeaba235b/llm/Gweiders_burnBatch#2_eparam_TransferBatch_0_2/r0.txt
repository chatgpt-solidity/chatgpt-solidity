NO

The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burnBatch` function, the `_to` argument is set to `address(0)` which indicates that tokens are being burned (removed from circulation), not transferred to another recipient. Therefore, the balance of the recipient is not increased, and the rule is not followed. The event `TransferBatch` is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_to` argument, which is correct for a burn operation but does not comply with the given rule.
