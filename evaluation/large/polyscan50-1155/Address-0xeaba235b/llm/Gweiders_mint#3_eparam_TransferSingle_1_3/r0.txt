The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_id` argument is indeed the token type being transferred, as required. Here's the relevant part of the `_mint` function:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender();
    uint256[] memory ids = _asSingletonArray(id);
    uint256[] memory amounts = _asSingletonArray(amount);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `id` parameter is used to create a singleton array `ids`, but the actual `id` is passed directly to the `TransferSingle` event, satisfying the rule that "_The `_id` argument MUST be the token type being transferred._"
