YES

The provided Solidity function `_mint` within the `ERC1155` contract correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to `amount`, which is the number of tokens that are being minted to the `to` address. The balance of the `to` address is increased by `amount` as indicated by the line `_balances[id][to] += amount;`, and since the tokens are being minted, the `_from` address is the zero address, indicating that the tokens are created rather than transferred from an existing holder.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct values, where `_operator` is the message sender (the one performing the mint operation), `_from` is the zero address (since tokens are minted), `_to` is the recipient's address, `_id` is the token type identifier, and `_value` is the number of tokens minted, which matches the increase in the recipient's balance. Therefore, the event is emitted according to the rule specified.
