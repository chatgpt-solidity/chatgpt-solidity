The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is evident from the following lines in the `_safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
unchecked {
    _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
}
_balances[id][to] += amount;

emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

The `from` variable is used as the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event, and it is the same address from which the balance is decreased (`_balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;`). Therefore, the event is emitted according to the rule specified.
