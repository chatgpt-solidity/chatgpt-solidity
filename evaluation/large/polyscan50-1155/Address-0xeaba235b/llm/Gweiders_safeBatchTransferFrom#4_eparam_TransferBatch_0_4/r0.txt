The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and must match what the recipient's balance is increased by. This is consistent with the behavior of the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

In the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, there is a loop that iterates over the `ids` and `amounts` arrays:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}
```

This loop ensures that for each token ID in `ids`, the corresponding amount in `amounts` is subtracted from the `from` address's balance and added to the `to` address's balance. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the operator, from and to addresses, and the `ids` and `amounts` arrays:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `amounts` array represents the `_values` argument in the event, and it matches the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by, as required by the rule. Therefore, the event is emitted correctly according to the rule provided.
