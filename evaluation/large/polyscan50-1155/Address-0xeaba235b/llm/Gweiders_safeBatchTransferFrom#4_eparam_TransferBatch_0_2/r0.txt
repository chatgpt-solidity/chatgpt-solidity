YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
        // ... (omitted code for brevity)
        _balances[id][to] += amount; // This line increases the balance of the recipient (`to`)
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts); // This line emits the event with the correct `_to` argument

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);` line is where the `TransferBatch` event is emitted. The `to` variable is used as the `_to` argument in the event, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `_balances[id][to] += amount;` line inside the loop. This behavior adheres to the specified rule.
