YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument passed to the `TransferSingle` event is obtained from the `id` parameter of the `_safeTransferFrom` function, which represents the token type being transferred. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct arguments, including the `_operator` (the message sender or the approved operator), `_from` (the address from which the tokens are transferred), `_to` (the address to which the tokens are transferred), `_id` (the token type), and `_value` (the amount of tokens transferred).
