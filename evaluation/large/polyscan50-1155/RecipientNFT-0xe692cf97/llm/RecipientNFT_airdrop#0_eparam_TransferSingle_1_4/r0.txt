YES

The `_mint` function within the `RecipientNFT` contract calls `emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);` after updating the recipient's balance with `_balances[id][to] += amount;`. The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to `amount`, which is the number of tokens minted for the recipient `to`. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder balance is increased by, which in the case of minting, is the amount the recipient's balance is increased by. Since the `from` address is `address(0)` for minting operations, there is no decrease in balance from the `from` address, and the rule is satisfied for the minting case.
