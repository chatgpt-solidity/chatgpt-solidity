The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract is responsible for creating tokens and assigning them to a recipient. The `_mint` function is called within the `airdrop` function of the `RecipientNFT` contract, which inherits from `ERC1155`.

The `_mint` function takes the `to` argument, which is the address of the recipient, and increases their balance by the specified `amount` of tokens with the given `id`. After updating the balance, the `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `to` address as the `_to` argument, as required by the rule.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:
- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred, which is the zero address (`address(0)`) in the case of minting.
- `_to`: The address of the recipient whose balance is increased, which is the `to` argument passed to the `_mint` function.
- `_id`: The token type identifier.
- `_value`: The number of tokens minted.

Since the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `to` address as the `_to` argument, and the `to` address is the recipient whose balance is increased, the event is emitted according to the given rule.
