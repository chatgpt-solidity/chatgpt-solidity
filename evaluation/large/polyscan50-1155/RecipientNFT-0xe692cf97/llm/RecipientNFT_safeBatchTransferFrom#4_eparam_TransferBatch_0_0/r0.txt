YES

The function `_safeBatchTransferFrom` emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator` argument being the address returned by `_msgSender()`. The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which is the public function that external callers would use, includes a requirement that ensures the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or an approved operator for the `from` address:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

This requirement guarantees that the `_operator` (which is set to `_msgSender()`) is indeed an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer. Therefore, the rule is followed, and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct `_operator` argument.
