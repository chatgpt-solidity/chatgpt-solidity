The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments. The `_value` argument in the event is the `amount` variable, which is the number of tokens to be transferred. The function ensures that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of the token type `id` by at least the `amount` to be transferred. The balance of the `from` address is decreased by `amount`, and the balance of the `to` address is increased by the same `amount`. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and match what the recipient's balance is increased by.
