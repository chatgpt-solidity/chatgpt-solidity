YES

The provided Solidity code for the `safeTransferFrom` function and its related parts in the ERC1155 contract includes several require statements and potential points where a revert or throw could occur if an error condition is met. If "any other error" occurs that is not explicitly handled by the code, the default behavior of Solidity is to revert the transaction.

For example, if the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function encounters an error when calling `onERC1155Received` on the `to` address (if it's a contract), and that contract does not properly implement the `IERC1155Receiver` interface or does not return the expected magic value, the transaction will revert with the provided error message.

Additionally, if there is an underflow in the balance subtraction due to an insufficient balance, or if the `to` address is the zero address, the transaction will revert due to the require statements.

Solidity also has built-in checks for conditions that are not explicitly handled by the code, such as out-of-gas errors, invalid opcode execution, or other low-level errors. These conditions will cause the EVM to revert the transaction as well.
