The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which is called by the `airdrop` function in the `RecipientNFT` contract. The `_mint` function is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id`, and assign them to `to`, which in this case is each recipient in the `recipients` array provided to the `airdrop` function.

The `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred, which is the zero address (`address(0)`) since tokens are being minted.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are transferred, which is the recipient's address.
- `_id`: The token type being transferred, which is the `coinbase` variable in the `RecipientNFT` contract.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being transferred, which is `1` in the `airdrop` function.

The rule states that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred, and in this case, it is. The `coinbase` variable represents the token type, and it is passed as the `id` argument to the `_mint` function, which in turn passes it to the `TransferSingle` event. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
