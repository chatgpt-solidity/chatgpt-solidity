The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule.

The relevant line in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function is:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This line is executed after the balances have been updated (the recipient's balance is increased), and it uses the `to` variable as the `_to` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, which is the address of the recipient. Therefore, the event is emitted according to the rule specified.
