NO

The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burn` function, the `_to` argument is set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which indicates that tokens are being burned and not transferred to any recipient. Therefore, the balance of the `_to` address is not increased; instead, the tokens are being destroyed.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_to` argument in the `_burn` function, which does not comply with the given rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The event is used here to indicate a burn operation rather than a transfer to a recipient.
