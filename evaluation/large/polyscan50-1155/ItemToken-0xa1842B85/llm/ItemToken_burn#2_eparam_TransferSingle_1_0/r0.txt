The `_burn` function within the `ERC1155` contract emits the `TransferSingle` event after performing the necessary checks and balance updates. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the current message sender (`msg.sender`). This is the expected behavior according to the rule provided.

The `burn` function in the `ERC1155Burnable` contract, which is an extension of `ERC1155`, calls `_burn` and passes the necessary parameters. It also ensures that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or an approved operator for the owner's account before allowing the burn operation to proceed.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument correctly set to the address that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.
