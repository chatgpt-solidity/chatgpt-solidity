The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_to` argument in the event is the `to` parameter of the `_mint` function, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `amount` of tokens of token type `id`. The event is emitted after the balance update, which is the correct behavior as per the rule.
