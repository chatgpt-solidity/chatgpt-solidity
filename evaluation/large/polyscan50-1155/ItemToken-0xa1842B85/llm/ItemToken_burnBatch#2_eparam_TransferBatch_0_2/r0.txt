NO

The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burnBatch` function, the `_to` argument is set to `address(0)` which indicates that tokens are being burned (removed from circulation), not transferred to a recipient whose balance would increase.

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_to` argument, which does not comply with the given rule that `_to` must be the address of a recipient with an increased balance. In the case of burning tokens, no recipient's balance is increased; instead, the balance of the `from` address is decreased.
