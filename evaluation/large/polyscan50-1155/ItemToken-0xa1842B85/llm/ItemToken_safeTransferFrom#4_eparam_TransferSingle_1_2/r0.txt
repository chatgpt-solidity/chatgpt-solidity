The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function. The `amount` of tokens of type `id` is added to the `_balances[id][to]`, which corresponds to the recipient's balance for the token type `id`. The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the correct parameters, including `_to` as the recipient address.
