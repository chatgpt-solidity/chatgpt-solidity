The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the `Context` contract. This ensures that the `_operator` is the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, as it should either be the token owner (`from == _msgSender()`) or an approved operator for the `from` address (`isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender())`).

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
    );
    _safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, amounts, data);
}

function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted for brevity)
    address operator = _msgSender();
    // ... (omitted for brevity)
    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
    // ... (omitted for brevity)
}
```

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function checks that the caller is either the token owner or an approved operator before calling `_safeBatchTransferFrom`. Inside `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, the `operator` is set to the value of `_msgSender()`, which is the current caller of the function, and then the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with this `operator` value. This aligns with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer.
