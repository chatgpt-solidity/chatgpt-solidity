The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the context of minting new tokens, there is no "from" address from which the balance is decreased, as new tokens are being created. In the provided `_mint` function, the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to `address(0)`, which is a convention used to indicate that tokens are minted rather than transferred from an existing holder. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event does not have a `_from` address that corresponds to a holder with a decreased balance, but rather it correctly indicates a mint operation by using `address(0)`.
