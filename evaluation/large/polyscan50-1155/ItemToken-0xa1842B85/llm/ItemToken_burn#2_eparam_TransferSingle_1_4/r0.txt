YES

The `_burn` function in the `ERC1155` contract is designed to destroy (`burn`) a certain `amount` of tokens of a specific token type `id` from a given address `from`. The function checks that the `from` address is not the zero address and that the `from` address has at least the `amount` of tokens to be burned.

After performing the necessary checks and updating the balance, the function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the burn operation (typically the token owner or an approved operator).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are burned.
- `_to`: The zero address, indicating that the tokens are being burned and not transferred to another account.
- `_id`: The token type identifier.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being burned.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_value` argument set to the `amount` of tokens that are being burned, which is the same amount by which the holder's balance is decreased. Since the `to` address is the zero address, it indicates that the tokens are being removed from circulation, and there is no recipient whose balance is being increased.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule, and the answer is "YES".
