The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred, and the event `TransferBatch` is emitted with the appropriate parameters: `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_ids`, and `_values` (which is named `amounts` in the function but represents the same concept).

The relevant part of the code is:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This line is called within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function after the balances have been updated to reflect the batch transfer. The `ids` array represents the list of token IDs being transferred, and the `amounts` array represents the corresponding values (quantities) for each token ID. The `operator` is the address that initiated the transfer, `from` is the address of the current token holder, and `to` is the address of the recipient.

The event is emitted before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook and the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function, which ensures that the event is emitted regardless of any additional logic that may be implemented in derived contracts.
