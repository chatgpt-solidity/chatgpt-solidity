The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract is designed to create (`amount`) tokens of token type (`id`), and assign them to (`to`). As part of this process, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`. This is typically the `msg.sender`, which is the account that initiated the transaction.
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred. In the case of minting, this is the zero address (`address(0)`), as tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing balance.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being minted.
- `_id`: The token type that is being minted.
- `_value`: The number of tokens of the specified type to mint.

The `airdrop` function in the `$3500USDC` contract calls `_mint` for each recipient that is not a contract, passing the recipient's address as `to`, the `coinbase` as `id`, and `1` as the `amount`. The `coinbase` variable is initialized to `0` and is not incremented within the provided code.

The `_mint` function correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the rule provided, with the `_operator` being the `msg.sender` (which is checked to be the owner of the contract due to the `onlyOwner` modifier in the `airdrop` function), `_from` being the zero address, `_to` being the recipient's address, `_id` being the `coinbase`, and `_value` being `1`.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
