The function `_safeBatchTransferFrom` within the `ERC1155` contract correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which returns the `msg.sender` of the transaction. This is consistent with the rule that the `_operator` must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer.

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which is the external function that would be called by users or contracts, includes a `require` statement that checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the tokens or is approved for all on behalf of the owner. This ensures that the `_operator` (which will be `msg.sender` in this context) is indeed authorized to make the transfer when `_safeBatchTransferFrom` is called.

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct `_operator` argument as per the rule provided.
