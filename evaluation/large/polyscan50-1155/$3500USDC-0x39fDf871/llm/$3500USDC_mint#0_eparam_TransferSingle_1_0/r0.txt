YES

The `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract emits the `TransferSingle` event as required by the ERC-1155 standard. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is an internal function that returns `msg.sender`. In the context of the `mint` function in the `$3500USDC` contract, `msg.sender` must be the owner of the contract because of the `onlyOwner` modifier, which restricts the function to be called only by the owner.

Therefore, the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`, and in this case, it is the owner of the contract. The rule is followed correctly.
