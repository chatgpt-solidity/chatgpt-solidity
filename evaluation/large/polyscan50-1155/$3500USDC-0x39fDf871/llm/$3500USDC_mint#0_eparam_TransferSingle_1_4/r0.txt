YES

The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id`, and assign them to the address `to`. The function emits a `TransferSingle` event, which is used to log the transfer of a single token type.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following parameters:
- `_operator`: The address which initiated the minting (usually the contract owner or the token contract itself).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred, which is `address(0)` in the case of minting.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are transferred (the recipient).
- `_id`: The token type that is being transferred.
- `_value`: The number of tokens that are being transferred.

In the provided code, the `_mint` function is called with the following arguments:
- `to`: The recipient address.
- `coinbase`: The token type (token ID).
- `1`: The amount of tokens to mint.
- `""`: An empty byte array for additional data.

The `_mint` function internally calls `_beforeTokenTransfer`, updates the recipient's balance, emits the `TransferSingle` event, calls `_afterTokenTransfer`, and performs a safe transfer acceptance check.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `amount` parameter set to the number of tokens minted, which is `1` in this case. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder balance is increased by, which is also the number of tokens the recipient balance is increased by.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule, and the answer is "YES".
