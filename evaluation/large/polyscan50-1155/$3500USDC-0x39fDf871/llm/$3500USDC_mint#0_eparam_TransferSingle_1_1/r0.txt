The `_mint` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to create (`amount`) tokens of token type (`id`), and assign them to the address (`to`). According to the ERC-1155 standard, minting is represented as a transfer from the zero address to the recipient address (`to`).

In the `_mint` function, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_from` argument set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which is the correct representation of minting new tokens. The `_to` argument is set to the recipient address (`to`), the `_id` argument is set to the token type (`id`), and the `_value` argument is set to the amount of tokens being minted (`amount`).

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. In the case of minting, the balance of the zero address is conceptually decreased (since new tokens are created), and the balance of the recipient address (`to`) is increased by the amount of tokens minted.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule when minting tokens.
