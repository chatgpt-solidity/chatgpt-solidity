The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_values` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is the `amounts` array, which represents the number of tokens to mint for each corresponding item ID in the `itemsIds` array. The `mintBatch` function increases the balance of the recipient (`to`) by the amounts specified in the `amounts` array for each item ID in the `itemsIds` array. This matches the rule that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder balance is increased by, which in the case of minting, is from the zero address (indicating token creation).

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is `msg.sender`.
- `_from`: The zero address, indicating that the tokens are being minted (created) rather than transferred from an existing holder.
- `_to`: The recipient address receiving the newly minted tokens.
- `_ids`: The list of item IDs for which tokens are being minted.
- `_values`: The list of amounts of tokens being minted for each item ID, which matches the increase in the recipient's balance.

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted in compliance with the rule provided.
