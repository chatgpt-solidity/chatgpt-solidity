The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the `to` parameter of the `mintBatch` function, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The balances are updated in the loop before the event is emitted, ensuring that the recipient's balance is indeed increased as per the event's emission.
