The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function calls the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` private function, which performs the actual transfer of tokens in batches. The function checks if the lengths of `ids` and `amounts` are equal, and then iterates over each id to transfer the corresponding amount from the `from` address to the `to` address. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `msg.sender` as the `_operator`, the `from` and `to` addresses, and the `ids` and `amounts` arrays as `_ids` and `_values`, respectively.

The rule states that the `_values` argument in the `TransferBatch` event must match the list and order of tokens specified in `_ids` and reflect the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by, which should also match the recipient's balance increase. The code correctly follows this rule by emitting the `TransferBatch` event after updating the balances with the same `ids` and `amounts` arrays, ensuring that the values represent the actual number of tokens transferred for each id.

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
