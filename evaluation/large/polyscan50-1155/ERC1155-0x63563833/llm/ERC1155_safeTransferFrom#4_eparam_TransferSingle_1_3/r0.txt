YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `_id` argument which represents the token type being transferred. The rule is followed as the `_id` argument passed to the `TransferSingle` event corresponds to the `id` parameter of the `_safeTransferFrom` function, which is the token type being transferred.
