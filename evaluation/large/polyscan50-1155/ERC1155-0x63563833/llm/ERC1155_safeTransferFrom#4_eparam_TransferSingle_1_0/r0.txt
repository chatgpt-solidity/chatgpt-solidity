YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` private function, which is called by the `safeTransferFrom` external function. The event is emitted with `msg.sender` as the `_operator` argument, which is correct according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, and it should be `msg.sender`. Since the `safeTransferFrom` function checks for approval before calling `_safeTransferFrom`, and since `msg.sender` is used as the `_operator` when emitting the event, the contract adheres to the rule.
