YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and its related parts in the ERC20 contract does not contain any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The `require` statements in the `_transfer` function check for the sender's balance being sufficient and that the sender and recipient addresses are not the zero address, but they do not prevent a transfer of 0 tokens.

Additionally, the `_spendAllowance` function checks for sufficient allowance, but again, this would not prevent an allowance of 0 from being spent (assuming the spender has an allowance of at least 0).

Therefore, the function should complete successfully with a transfer of 0 tokens, assuming all other conditions (like valid addresses and sufficient allowance) are met.
