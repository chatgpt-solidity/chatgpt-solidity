The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function calls the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` private function, which performs the actual transfer of tokens in batches. The loop within `_safeBatchTransferFrom` iterates over the `ids` array and for each ID, it decreases the balance of the `from` address and increases the balance of the `to` address by the corresponding amount specified in the `amounts` array.

After the balances have been updated, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `msg.sender` as the `_operator`, the `from` address as `_from`, the `to` address as `_to`, the `ids` array as `_ids`, and the `amounts` array as `_values`. This matches the rule specified, as the `_values` argument (which is the `amounts` array in the code) represents the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by, in the order specified by the `_ids` array.

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
