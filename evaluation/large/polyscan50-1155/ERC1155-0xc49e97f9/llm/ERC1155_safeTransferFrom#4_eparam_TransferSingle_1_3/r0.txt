The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted within the `_safeTransferFrom` private function, which is called by the `safeTransferFrom` external function.

The event `TransferSingle` is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the transfer, which in this case is `msg.sender`.
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being transferred.
- `_id`: The token type being transferred.
- `_value`: The number of tokens of the specified token type to be transferred.

The arguments passed to the `TransferSingle` event match the rule specified, with `_id` being the token type being transferred.
