The `mintBatch` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with a hardcoded `_value` of 1 for each item minted. However, the rule states that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the holder balance is increased by. Since the function does not take into account the actual number of tokens being minted for each `itemsIds[i]` (it always assumes the value to be 1), it does not necessarily follow the rule if the intention was to mint a different number of tokens for any of the item IDs.

If the contract is designed to always mint exactly one token per item ID, then the function would be correct. However, the rule as stated requires that `_value` reflects the actual change in balance, which implies that the function should support minting a variable number of tokens per item ID. The provided function does not support this and always mints exactly one token per item ID, so it does not follow the rule if the rule is interpreted to require this flexibility.
