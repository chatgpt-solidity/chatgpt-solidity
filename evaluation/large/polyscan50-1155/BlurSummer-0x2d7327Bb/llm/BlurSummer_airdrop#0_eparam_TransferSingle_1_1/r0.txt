The `TransferSingle` event is emitted within the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract. According to the ERC-1155 standard, when minting new tokens, the `_from` argument should be the zero address (0x000...000) to indicate that tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder.

In the provided `_mint` function, the `TransferSingle` event is correctly emitted with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```

This is consistent with the rule that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. Since minting creates new tokens, there is no holder from whom the balance is decreased, hence the zero address is used.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule when minting new tokens.
