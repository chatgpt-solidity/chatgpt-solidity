The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is ensured by the following line of code within the `_safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

Here, the `from` variable represents the address of the holder from whom the tokens are being transferred, and the `amount` is the number of tokens being transferred. The `from` variable is used as the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event, which complies with the rule that "_from argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased".
