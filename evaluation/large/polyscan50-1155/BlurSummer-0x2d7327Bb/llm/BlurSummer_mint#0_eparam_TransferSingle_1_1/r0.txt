YES

The `_mint` function in the provided contract code emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_from` argument set to the zero address, which is the correct behavior for a mint operation according to the ERC-1155 standard. When minting new tokens, the `_from` field should be the zero address to indicate that the tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder. The `_to` argument is the address of the recipient who will receive the newly minted tokens, and the `_id` and `_value` arguments represent the token type and the amount of tokens minted, respectively.

In the provided `_mint` function, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following parameters:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```

Here, `operator` is the address that initiated the mint operation (typically the contract owner in this case), `address(0)` is the zero address indicating token creation, `to` is the recipient's address, `id` is the token type, and `amount` is the number of tokens minted. This matches the rule that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, which in the case of minting is the zero address.
