The function `_safeTransferFrom` in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument in the event is indeed the token type being transferred, as required by the rule. The event is emitted with the correct parameters, including the `_operator` (the message sender or the approved operator), `_from` (the address from which the tokens are being transferred), `_to` (the address to which the tokens are being transferred), `_id` (the token type), and `_value` (the amount of tokens being transferred).
