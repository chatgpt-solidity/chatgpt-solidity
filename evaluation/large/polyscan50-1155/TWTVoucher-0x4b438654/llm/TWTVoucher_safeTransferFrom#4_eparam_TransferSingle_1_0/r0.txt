YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or an approved operator for the `from` address before proceeding with the transfer. This is done with the following requirement:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

If the caller is not the token owner, they must be an approved operator, as determined by the `isApprovedForAll` function. Once this check passes, the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function is called, which eventually emits the `TransferSingle` event:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

The `operator` variable used in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the value of `_msgSender()`:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
```

Since `_msgSender()` returns the `msg.sender` of the transaction, and the `msg.sender` has already been verified to be the token owner or an approved operator, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted with the `_operator` argument being the address that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted according to the given rule.
