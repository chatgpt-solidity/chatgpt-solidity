YES

The function `_safeBatchTransferFrom` emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator` argument being the address returned by `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function, as defined in the `Context` contract, returns `msg.sender`, which is the address of the entity that called the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function requires that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner (`from`) or an approved operator for the owner's account, as checked by the `require` statement:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

This ensures that the `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is indeed an address that is approved to make the transfer, satisfying the given rule.
