The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments as per the rule. The `_to` argument in the event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `amount` of tokens of type `id`. The event is emitted after the balance update and before the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function call, which ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the tokens if it is a contract.
