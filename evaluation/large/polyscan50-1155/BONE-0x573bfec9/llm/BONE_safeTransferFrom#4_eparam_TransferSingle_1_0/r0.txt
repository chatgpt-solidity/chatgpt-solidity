YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the `Context` contract. This address is the one that initiated the transaction and is either the token owner or an approved operator, as checked by the `require` statement at the beginning of the `safeTransferFrom` function. Therefore, the event is emitted with the correct `_operator` argument as per the rule.
