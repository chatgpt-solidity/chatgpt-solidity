The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument passed to the `TransferBatch` event is the list of tokens being transferred, as required by the rule. The `amounts` array, which is passed as the `_values` argument to the event, represents the corresponding amounts of each token in the `_ids` array that are being transferred.

The relevant line in the code is:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This line is within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` public function. The `ids` array represents the list of token IDs being transferred, and the `amounts` array represents the corresponding amounts for each token ID. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated, which ensures that the state changes are reflected before the event is emitted, adhering to the rule specified.
