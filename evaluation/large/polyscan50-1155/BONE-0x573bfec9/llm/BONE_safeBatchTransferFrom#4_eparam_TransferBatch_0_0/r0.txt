The function `_safeBatchTransferFrom` emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator` argument set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which returns `msg.sender`. This is consistent with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` public function, which is the external interface that calls `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, requires that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or an approved operator:

```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
    );
    _safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

This ensures that the `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is indeed an approved entity to make the transfer, as per the given rule.
