The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function, which is called within the `airdrop` function. The `_mint` function is designed to create (`mint`) new tokens and assign them to a recipient (`to`). In the context of minting new tokens, the `_from` argument is the zero address, as new tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder.

The `_mint` function correctly sets the `_from` argument to the zero address when emitting the `TransferSingle` event, as shown in the line:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```

This is consistent with the ERC-1155 standard for minting new tokens, where the `_from` address is the zero address to indicate that tokens are being created and not transferred from an existing balance. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule when new tokens are minted.
