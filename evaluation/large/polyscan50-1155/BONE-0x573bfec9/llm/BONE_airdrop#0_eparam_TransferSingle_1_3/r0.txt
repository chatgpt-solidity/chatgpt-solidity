The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is called by the `airdrop` function in the `BONE` contract, which inherits from `ERC1155`. The `_mint` function takes the `to` address, the token `id`, the `amount`, and some `data` as arguments. It then calls `_beforeTokenTransfer`, updates the balances, emits the `TransferSingle` event, calls `_afterTokenTransfer`, and finally performs a safe transfer acceptance check.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred, which is the zero address in the case of minting.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being minted.
- `_id`: The token type being transferred, which is the current token ID (`_currentTokenId`) in the `BONE` contract.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being transferred, which is set to 1 in the `airdrop` function.

The rule states that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred, and in this case, it is. The `airdrop` function only mints tokens of the current token ID (`_currentTokenId`) to the recipients that are not contracts, and the `TransferSingle` event correctly reflects this token ID as the `_id` argument. Therefore, the event is emitted according to the given rule.
