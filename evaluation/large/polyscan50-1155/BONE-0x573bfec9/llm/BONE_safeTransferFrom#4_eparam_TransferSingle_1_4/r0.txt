The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function, which is called by the `safeTransferFrom` function. The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the `amount` parameter of the `_safeTransferFrom` function. This `amount` is the number of tokens to be transferred from the `from` address to the `to` address.

The function checks that the `from` address has a sufficient balance (`fromBalance >= amount`) before performing the transfer. It then decreases the balance of the `from` address by the `amount` and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. This ensures that the `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event matches the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by, as per the given rule.
