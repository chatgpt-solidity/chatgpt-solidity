NO

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument, which is a convention used to indicate that tokens are being minted (created) rather than transferred from an existing holder. The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, but in the case of minting, there is no holder from whom the balance is decreased, as new tokens are being created. Therefore, the rule does not apply to minting operations, and the event is emitted correctly according to the common practice for minting events in ERC-1155 contracts.
