The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the `amount` argument, which represents the number of tokens to be transferred. The function checks that the `amount` is not greater than the balance of the `from` address for the given token `id` before proceeding with the transfer. If the balance is sufficient, the function decreases the balance of the `from` address by `amount` and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. After updating the balances, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `amount` as the `_value`, which satisfies the given rule that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by.
