YES

The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code emits the `TransferSingle` event for each token type being transferred. The `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to `itemsIds[i]`, which corresponds to the token type being transferred to the address `to[i]`. The `_value` argument is set to `1`, indicating that one unit of the token type is being minted and transferred.

The rule states that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred, and the code adheres to this rule by using `itemsIds[i]` as the `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted according to the given rule.
