The `mint` function in the `Binance` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id` and assign them to the `to` address. The `mint` function in the `Binance` contract specifies the `to` address as the recipient of the newly minted tokens.

The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract performs several actions:

1. It checks that the `to` address is not the zero address.
2. It updates the balance of the `to` address by increasing it by the `amount` of tokens minted.
3. It emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator` (the message sender), `from` address (which is the zero address since tokens are being minted), `to` address, `id` of the token, and `amount` of tokens minted.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_to` argument set to the `to` address provided to the `_mint` function, which is the address whose balance is increased by the minting process. This is in accordance with the given rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
