The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments. The `_value` argument is set to `amount`, which is the number of tokens to be transferred. The function ensures that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of tokens of type `id` by at least `amount` before the transfer occurs. After the balance check, the function decreases the balance of the `from` address by `amount` and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and match what the recipient's balance is increased by.
