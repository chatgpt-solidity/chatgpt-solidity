The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule.

Here's the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
        // ... (omitted code for brevity)
        _balances[id][to] += amount;
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

In the loop, the balances of the recipient (`to`) are increased by the specified `amounts` for each token ID in `ids`. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `to` address as the `_to` argument, which is the recipient's address. This matches the rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
