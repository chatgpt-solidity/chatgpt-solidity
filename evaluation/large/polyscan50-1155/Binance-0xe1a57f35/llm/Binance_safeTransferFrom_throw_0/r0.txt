YES

The `_safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code includes a requirement that checks if the `to` address is the zero address:

```solidity
require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: transfer to the zero address");
```

If the `to` address (`_to` in the condition) is the zero address, this `require` statement will fail, causing the function to revert with the message "ERC1155: transfer to the zero address". Therefore, under the given condition, the function will throw (revert the transaction).
