YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the given rule. The `_from` argument is set to `address(0)` which is the correct value for a mint operation, indicating that the tokens are created from nothing and assigned to the `to` address. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted after the token balance is updated with `_balances[id][to] += amount;` and before the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, which is the correct order of operations for a minting function.
