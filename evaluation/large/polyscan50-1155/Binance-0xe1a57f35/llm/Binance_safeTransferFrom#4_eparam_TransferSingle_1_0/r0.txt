YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction. This is the account that initiated the transaction and is either the token owner or an approved operator, as enforced by the `require` statement at the beginning of the `safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

This check ensures that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the token or an approved operator for the `from` address. If this check passes, the `_safeTransferFrom` function is called, which eventually emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_operator` argument set to the address of the approved account/contract, satisfying the rule:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

Here, `operator` is assigned the value of `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction, as per the rule.
