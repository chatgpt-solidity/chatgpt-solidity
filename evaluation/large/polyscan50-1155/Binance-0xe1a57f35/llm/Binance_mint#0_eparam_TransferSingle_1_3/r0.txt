YES

The `mint` function in the `Binance` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract with the `coinbase` variable as the `_id` argument. The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `id` parameter being passed from the `mint` function, which in this case is the `coinbase` variable.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_id` argument set to the value of `coinbase`, which represents the token type being transferred (minted in this case). Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted according to the given rule, where `_id` is the token type being transferred.
