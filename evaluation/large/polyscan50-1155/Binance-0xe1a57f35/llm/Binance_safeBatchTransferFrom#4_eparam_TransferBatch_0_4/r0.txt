The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by. In the code, the `amounts` array represents the number of tokens to be transferred for each token ID in the `ids` array.

The `for` loop within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function iterates over each `id` and corresponding `amount` in the `ids` and `amounts` arrays, respectively. It decreases the balance of the `from` address and increases the balance of the `to` address by the specified `amount` for each `id`. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, and `amounts` as arguments, which aligns with the rule provided.

Here is the relevant part of the code that ensures the rule is followed:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}

emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);` line confirms that the event is emitted with the correct values as per the rule.
