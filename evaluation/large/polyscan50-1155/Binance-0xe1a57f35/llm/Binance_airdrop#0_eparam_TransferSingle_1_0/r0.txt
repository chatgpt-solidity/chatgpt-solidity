YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is called within the `airdrop` function of the `Binance` contract, which is restricted to the contract owner by the `onlyOwner` modifier.

The `_mint` function sets the `operator` to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the `airdrop` function. Since the `airdrop` function can only be called by the owner of the contract (due to the `onlyOwner` modifier), the `msg.sender` (and thus `_operator`) is indeed an account that is approved to make the transfer.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument being the address that is approved to make the transfer, which complies with the given rule.
