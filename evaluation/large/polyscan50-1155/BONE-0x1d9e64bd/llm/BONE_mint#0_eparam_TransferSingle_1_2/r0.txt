The `mint` function in the `BONE` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract, which in turn emits the `TransferSingle` event. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the `to` parameter passed to the `_mint` function, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This is in accordance with the given rule.
