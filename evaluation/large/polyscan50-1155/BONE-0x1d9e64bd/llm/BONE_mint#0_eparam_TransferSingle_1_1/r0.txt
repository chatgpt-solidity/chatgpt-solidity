YES

The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_from` argument set to the zero address, which is the correct behavior for a mint operation. The zero address (`address(0)`) is used to indicate that new tokens are being created and not transferred from an existing holder. The `_mint` function is called by the `mint` function in the `BONE` contract, which is derived from `ERC1155`. The `mint` function does not modify the `_from` argument, so the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_from` address as the zero address, adhering to the given rule.
