The `airdrop` function in the `BONE` contract calls the `_mint` function for each recipient in the `recipients` array, provided that the recipient is not a contract (checked by the `isContract` function). The `_mint` function, which is part of the `ERC1155` contract, is responsible for creating tokens and assigning them to the `to` address.

The `_mint` function does the following:
1. Checks that the `to` address is not the zero address.
2. Calls `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook.
3. Increases the balance of the `to` address by the `amount`.
4. Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator` (the sender of the message), `from` address (zero address since it's a mint operation), `to` address, `id` of the token, and `amount` of tokens.
5. Calls `_afterTokenTransfer` hook.
6. Performs a safe transfer acceptance check if `to` is a contract.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, which complies with the given rule. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted according to the rule.
