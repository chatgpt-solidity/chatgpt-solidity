YES

The `mint` function in the `BONE` contract calls the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function, in turn, emits the `TransferSingle` event. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. This is consistent with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This is equivalent to msg.sender

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount); // Emitting the event with the operator as msg.sender

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

Since the `mint` function is only callable by the owner (due to the `onlyOwner` modifier), and the `_mint` function uses `_msgSender()` as the operator when emitting the `TransferSingle` event, the rule is followed.
