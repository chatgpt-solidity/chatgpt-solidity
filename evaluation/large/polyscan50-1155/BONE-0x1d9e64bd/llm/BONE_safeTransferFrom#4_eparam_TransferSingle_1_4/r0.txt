The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the `amount` argument, which represents the number of tokens to be transferred. The function ensures that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of tokens of type `id` by at least `amount` before proceeding with the transfer. The balance of the `from` address is decreased by `amount`, and the balance of the `to` address is increased by the same `amount`. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument (which is `amount` in this case) must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and match what the recipient's balance is increased by.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event correctly reflects the transfer of tokens according to the given rule.
