YES

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function after the balances have been updated and before the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called. The event is emitted with the `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, and `amounts` parameters, which correspond to the `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_ids`, and `_values` arguments as specified in the rule.

The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and match what the recipient's balance is increased by. In the provided code, the `amounts` array represents the number of tokens to be transferred for each token ID in the `ids` array. The balances are updated accordingly before the event is emitted, ensuring that the `amounts` array reflects the correct number of tokens transferred.

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
