The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and must match what the recipient's balance is increased by. The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `ids` and `amounts` arrays, which represent the token IDs and the corresponding number of tokens to transfer, respectively.

The function ensures that the lengths of `ids` and `amounts` are the same and that the `to` address is not zero. It also checks that the balance of `from` for each token ID is sufficient for the transfer. The balances are updated accordingly before the event is emitted, ensuring that the `amounts` array represents the actual number of tokens transferred.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms the rule is followed:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}

emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `amounts` array is used to decrease the balance of the `from` address and increase the balance of the `to` address for each token ID in the `ids` array. The `TransferBatch` event is then emitted with the `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, and `amounts` as arguments, satisfying the rule.
