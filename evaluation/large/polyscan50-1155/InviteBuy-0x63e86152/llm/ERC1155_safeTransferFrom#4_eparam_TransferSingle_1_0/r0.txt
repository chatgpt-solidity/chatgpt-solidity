YES

The function `_safeTransferFrom` within the `ERC1155` contract emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator` argument set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function is designed to return the `msg.sender`, which is the address of the entity that initiated the transaction.

The `safeTransferFrom` function, which is the public entry point for token transfers, includes a requirement that ensures the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or an approved operator:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

This requirement guarantees that the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event will always be an address that is approved to make the transfer, either because it is the token owner or because it has been granted approval via `isApprovedForAll`.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
