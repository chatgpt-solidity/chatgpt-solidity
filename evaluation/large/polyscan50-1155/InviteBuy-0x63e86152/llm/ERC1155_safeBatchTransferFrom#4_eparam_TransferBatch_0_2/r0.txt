YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument set to the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the batch transfer. This is done in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function, which is called by `safeBatchTransferFrom`.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (other checks and logic)

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
        uint256 id = ids[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        // ... (balance checks and updates)

        _balances[id][to] += amount; // Increases the balance of the recipient
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts); // Emits the event with the correct '_to' argument

    // ... (other logic)
}
```

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted after the balances have been updated, and it uses the `to` variable as the `_to` argument in the event, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. Therefore, the code complies with the given rule.
