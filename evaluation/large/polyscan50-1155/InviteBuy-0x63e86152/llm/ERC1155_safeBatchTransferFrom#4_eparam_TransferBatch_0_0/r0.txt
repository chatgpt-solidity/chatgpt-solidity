The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. This ensures that the `_operator` is the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, as required by the rule.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This gets the msg.sender

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts); // Emitting the event with the correct _operator

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function calls `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, which performs the necessary checks, updates balances, and then emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator` set to the address of the entity that initiated the transaction (`msg.sender`). This is in compliance with the rule specified.
