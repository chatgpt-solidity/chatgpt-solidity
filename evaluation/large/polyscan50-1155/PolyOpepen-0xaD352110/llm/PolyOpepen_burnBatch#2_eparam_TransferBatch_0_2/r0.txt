NO

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_burnBatch` function with the `_to` argument set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which indicates that tokens are being burned (removed from circulation), not transferred to a recipient whose balance is increased. The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, which is not the case here since the tokens are being burned.
