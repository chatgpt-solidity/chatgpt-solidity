The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which is called by the `mint` function in the `PolyOpepen` contract. The `_mint` function takes an `id` argument, which represents the token type being minted and transferred to the `to` address. The `TransferSingle` event is then emitted with the `_id` parameter set to the `id` argument of the `_mint` function, which satisfies the given rule that "_id argument MUST be the token type being transferred."
