The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred, and the `_values` argument corresponds to the amounts of each token being transferred. The event is emitted with the correct parameters after the balances have been updated and before the acceptance check is performed for the receiving contract (if the `to` address is a contract).
