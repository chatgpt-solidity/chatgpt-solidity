The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract with the `_from` argument set to the zero address (`address(0)`). This is the correct behavior for a mint operation, as minting is conceptually the creation of new tokens from the zero address to the recipient's address (`_to`). The zero address is used to represent that the tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder.

The `_mint` function is called by the `mint` function in the `PolyOpepen` contract, which is restricted to the contract owner by the `onlyOwner` modifier. The `mint` function does not directly emit the `TransferSingle` event; instead, it relies on the internal `_mint` function to handle the token creation and event emission.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the minting (typically the contract owner in this case).
- `_from`: The zero address, indicating that tokens are being minted.
- `_to`: The address of the recipient.
- `_id`: The token type being minted.
- `_value`: The amount of tokens being minted.

This behavior adheres to the rule that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. In the case of minting, there is no holder from whom the balance is decreased, so the zero address is used.
