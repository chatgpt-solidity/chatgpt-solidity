YES

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_burnBatch` function within the `ERC1155` contract. The `_burnBatch` function is called by the `burnBatch` function in the `ERC1155Burnable` contract. The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct arguments, including `_ids` which represents the list of tokens being burned (transferred to the zero address, which is considered a burn operation).

The `_burnBatch` function ensures that the `ids` and `amounts` arrays have the same length, which is a requirement for the `TransferBatch` event according to the rule provided. The event is emitted with the `_operator` as the caller of the function, `_from` as the address from which the tokens are being burned, `_to` as the zero address (since it's a burn operation), `_ids` as the list of token IDs being burned, and `_values` as the corresponding amounts of each token ID being burned.

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
