The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which is called by the `mint` function in the `PolyOpepen` contract. The `_mint` function takes the `to` argument (named `account` in the `mint` function of `PolyOpepen`), which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This address is passed to the `TransferSingle` event as the `_to` argument, satisfying the given rule.
