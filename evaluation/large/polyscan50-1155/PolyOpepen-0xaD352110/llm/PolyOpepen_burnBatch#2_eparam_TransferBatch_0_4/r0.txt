The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_burnBatch` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which is called by the `burnBatch` function of the `ERC1155Burnable` contract. The `_burnBatch` function ensures that the `ids` and `amounts` arrays have the same length, and it decreases the balance of the `from` address by the amounts specified in the `amounts` array for each corresponding token ID in the `ids` array. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `_operator` as the caller of the function, `_from` as the address from which tokens are burned, `_to` as the zero address (since tokens are being burned), `_ids` as the list of token IDs, and `_values` as the list of amounts by which the holder's balance is decreased.

This behavior matches the given rule that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by, which also matches what the recipient's balance would be increased by if it were a transfer to a non-zero address. However, since this is a burn operation, the recipient is the zero address, and no actual increase in balance occurs for any recipient. The event correctly reflects the burn operation as specified by the rule.
