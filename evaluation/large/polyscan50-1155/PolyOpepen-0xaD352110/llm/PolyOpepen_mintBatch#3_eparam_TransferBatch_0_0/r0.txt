The `mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code calls the `_mintBatch` internal function, which is responsible for minting a batch of tokens. The `_mintBatch` function emits the `TransferBatch` event as required by the ERC-1155 standard.

The `_mintBatch` function sets the `operator` to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. This is in line with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mintBatch(
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");
    require(ids.length == amounts.length, "ERC1155: ids and amounts length mismatch");

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This is equivalent to msg.sender

    _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
        _balances[ids[i]][to] += amounts[i];
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts); // TransferBatch event is emitted here

    _afterTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator` set to the address of the sender of the transaction, which complies with the given rule.
