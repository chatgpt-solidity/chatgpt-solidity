YES

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the tokens or an approved operator for the `from` address before proceeding with the transfer. This is done by the following line of code:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

If this requirement is met, the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function is called, and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
...
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

Since the `_operator` in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the `msg.sender` who must be approved to make the transfer, the rule is followed, and the event is emitted correctly according to the given rule.
