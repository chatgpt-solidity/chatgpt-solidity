The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_values` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is the `amounts` array, which represents the number of tokens to be transferred for each token ID specified in the `ids` array.

The function ensures that the `ids` and `amounts` arrays have the same length and that the balance of the sender (`from`) for each token ID is sufficient for the transfer. It then decreases the sender's balance and increases the recipient's (`to`) balance by the corresponding amount for each token ID. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, and `amounts` as arguments, which satisfies the rule that the `_values` argument must match the list and order of tokens specified in `_ids` and reflect the actual balance changes.

Here is the relevant part of the code that ensures the rule is followed:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}

emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);` line is where the event is emitted, and it uses the `amounts` array as the `_values` argument, which is the list of the number of tokens the holder balance is decreased by and what the recipient balance is increased by.
