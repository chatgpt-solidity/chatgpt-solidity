The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` private function with the correct order of arguments as specified by the rule. The `_to` argument in the event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the batch transfer. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and before the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, which is the correct behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard.
