The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` private function, which is called by the `safeTransferFrom` external function. The event is emitted with the correct arguments, including the `_id` argument which represents the token type being transferred. The arguments passed to the event match the required rule for the `TransferSingle` event.
