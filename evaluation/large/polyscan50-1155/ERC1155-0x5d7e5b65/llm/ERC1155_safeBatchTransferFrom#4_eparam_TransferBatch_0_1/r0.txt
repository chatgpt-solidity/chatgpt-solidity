The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` private function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` external function. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and before the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called.

The event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the transfer (in this case, `msg.sender`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being transferred.
- `_ids`: An array of token IDs.
- `_values`: An array of the amounts of tokens being transferred.

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. In the provided function, the `_from` argument is indeed the address from which the token balances are being deducted, as seen in the loop where `_balances[ids[i]][from]` is decreased by `amounts[i]` for each token ID.

Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
