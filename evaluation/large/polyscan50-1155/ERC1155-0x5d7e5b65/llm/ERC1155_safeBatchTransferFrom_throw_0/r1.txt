The provided Solidity code does not include an explicit check for the `_to` address being the zero address within the `safeBatchTransferFrom` or `_safeBatchTransferFrom` functions. In typical ERC-1155 implementations, there should be a check to prevent transfers to the zero address, as this would effectively burn the tokens without a burn function being called and could lead to loss of assets.

However, since the code snippet provided does not show such a check, the function will not throw an error if `to` is the zero address based on the code provided. Instead, it will proceed to execute the transfer, which could result in an unintended loss of tokens.

Therefore, the answer to whether the function will throw if `to` is the zero address is "NO", given the code provided. It is important to note that this is a potential issue and it would be advisable to add a check like `require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: transfer to the zero address");` to prevent such cases.
