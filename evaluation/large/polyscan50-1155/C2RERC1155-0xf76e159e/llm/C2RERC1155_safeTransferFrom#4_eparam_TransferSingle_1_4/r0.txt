The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the `amount` argument, which represents the number of tokens to be transferred. The function ensures that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of the token type `id` by at least the `amount` to be transferred. It then decreases the balance of the `from` address by `amount` and increases the balance of the `to` address by the same `amount`. This matches the rule that the `_value` argument (which is `amount` in this case) must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and match what the recipient's balance is increased by.

The event is emitted with the correct values for `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_id`, and `_value` as required by the rule.
