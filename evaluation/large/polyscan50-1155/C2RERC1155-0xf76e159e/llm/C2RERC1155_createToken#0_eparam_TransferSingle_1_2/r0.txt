The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract is responsible for creating tokens and assigning them to a recipient address (`to`). The function emits a `TransferSingle` event with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred. In the case of minting, this is the zero address (`address(0)`), indicating that new tokens are being created.
- `_to`: The address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This is the `to` parameter passed to the `_mint` function.
- `_id`: The token type identifier.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being minted and transferred to the `to` address.

The `createToken` function in the `C2RERC1155` contract calls the `_mint` function, passing `msg.sender` as the `to` argument, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This complies with the given rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly according to the rule.
