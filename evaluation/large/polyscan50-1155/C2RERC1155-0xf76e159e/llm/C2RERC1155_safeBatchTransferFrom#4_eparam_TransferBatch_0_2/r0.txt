The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the batch transfer. This is ensured by the following line of code within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `to` variable in the `emit` statement corresponds to the `_to` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, and it is the address to which the token amounts are being transferred. The balances of the `to` address are increased for each token ID in the `ids` array by the corresponding amount in the `amounts` array, as seen in the loop just before the event is emitted:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(
        fromBalance >= amount,
        "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer"
    );
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}
```

This code ensures that the `to` address's balance for each token ID is increased by the specified amount before the `TransferBatch` event is emitted, complying with the rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.
