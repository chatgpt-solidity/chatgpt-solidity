The `createToken` function in the `C2RERC1155` contract calls the `_mint` function, which in turn emits the `TransferSingle` event. The `_mint` function is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id`, and assign them to `to`. In this case, the `amount` is hardcoded as `4100` tokens.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`msg.sender`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are transferred, which is `address(0)` since it's a mint operation.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are minted, which is the message sender (`msg.sender`).
- `_id`: The token type ID, which is `newItemId` generated by incrementing `_tokenIds`.
- `_value`: The number of tokens minted, which is `4100`.

The rule states that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the holder's balance is increased by. Since the `_balances` mapping is updated with `amount` (which is `4100`) before the event is emitted, and the `_value` in the `TransferSingle` event is also `4100`, the rule is satisfied. The holder's balance is increased by `4100`, and the `TransferSingle` event reflects this exact increase.
