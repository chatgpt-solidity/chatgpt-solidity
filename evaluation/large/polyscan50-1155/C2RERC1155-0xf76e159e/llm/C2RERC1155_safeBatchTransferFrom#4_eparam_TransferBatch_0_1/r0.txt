The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is ensured by the following line in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

Here, the `from` variable is used as the `_from` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, which is the address from which the tokens are being transferred, thus decreasing the balance of the `from` address. The `from` address is passed to the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which is the public function that external callers use to initiate a batch transfer. The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function checks that the caller is either the token holder or an approved operator for the holder, ensuring that the `from` address is indeed the holder whose balance will be decreased.
