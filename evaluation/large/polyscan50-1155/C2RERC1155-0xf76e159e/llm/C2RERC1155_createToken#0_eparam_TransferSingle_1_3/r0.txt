The `createToken` function in the `C2RERC1155` contract calls the `_mint` function, which is responsible for creating new tokens. The `_mint` function, in turn, emits the `TransferSingle` event as required by the ERC-1155 standard.

The `_mint` function is defined as follows:

```solidity
function _mint(
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address which initiated the minting (in this case, it would be the `_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred. Since this is a mint operation, the `_from` address is `address(0)` to indicate that new tokens are being created.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being minted.
- `_id`: The token type being transferred. This is the `id` argument passed to the `_mint` function.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being transferred. This is the `amount` argument passed to the `_mint` function.

The rule states that the `_id` argument must be the token type being transferred, and in the `createToken` function, the `newItemId` is used as the `id` argument for the `_mint` function, which is the correct token type being minted. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
