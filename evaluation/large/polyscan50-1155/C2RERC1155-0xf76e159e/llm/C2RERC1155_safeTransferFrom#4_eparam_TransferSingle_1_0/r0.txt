The function `_safeTransferFrom` emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator` variable as the `_operator` argument. The `operator` variable is assigned the value of `_msgSender()` which is a function that returns `msg.sender`. This means that the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, as it should be according to the rule provided.
