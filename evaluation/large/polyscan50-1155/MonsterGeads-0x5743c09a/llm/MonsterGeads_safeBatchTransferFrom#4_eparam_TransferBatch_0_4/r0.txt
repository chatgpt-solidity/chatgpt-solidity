The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and must match what the recipient's balance is increased by. The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `ids` and `amounts` arrays, which represent the token types and the corresponding number of tokens being transferred.

In the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, there is a loop that iterates over the `ids` and `amounts` arrays:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}
```

This loop ensures that for each token type (`id`) specified in the `ids` array, the corresponding number of tokens (`amount`) is deducted from the `from` address's balance and added to the `to` address's balance. After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the operator, from and to addresses, and the `ids` and `amounts` arrays:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This behavior aligns with the rule provided, as the `amounts` array represents the number of tokens that the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by. Therefore, the event `TransferBatch` is emitted correctly according to the rule.
