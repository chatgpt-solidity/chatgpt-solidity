The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments. The `_value` argument in the event is the `amount` variable, which is the number of tokens to be transferred. The function checks that the `from` address has a sufficient balance of the token type `id` before the transfer occurs, and the balance of the `from` address is decreased by `amount` while the balance of the `to` address is increased by the same `amount`. This ensures that the `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event matches the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by, as per the given rule.
