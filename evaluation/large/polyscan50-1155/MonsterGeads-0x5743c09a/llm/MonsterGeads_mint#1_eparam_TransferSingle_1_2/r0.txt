YES

The `_mint` function in the `MonsterGeads` contract calls the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which emits the `TransferSingle` event. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule.

Here's the relevant part of the code from the `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender();
    uint256[] memory ids = _asSingletonArray(id);
    uint256[] memory amounts = _asSingletonArray(amount);

    _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _afterTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
}
```

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `to` parameter being the recipient's address, which is consistent with the rule provided.
