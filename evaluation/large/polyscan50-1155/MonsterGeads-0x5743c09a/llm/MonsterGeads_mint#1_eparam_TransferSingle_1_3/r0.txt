YES

The `_mint` function in the `MonsterGeads` contract calls the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` base contract, which in turn emits the `TransferSingle` event. The `_id` argument passed to the `TransferSingle` event is obtained from the `_asSingletonArray(id)` call, which creates an array containing the single `id` value representing the token type being transferred. This `id` is the same `id` that was passed to the `_mint` function, which means the rule is followed, and the `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the token type being transferred.
