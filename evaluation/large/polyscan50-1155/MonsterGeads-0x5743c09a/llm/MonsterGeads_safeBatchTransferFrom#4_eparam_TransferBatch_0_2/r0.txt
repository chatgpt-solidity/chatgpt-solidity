The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the batch transfer. This is ensured by the following line of code within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

Here, the `to` variable represents the recipient's address, and it is used as the `_to` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, which matches the rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The `ids` and `amounts` arrays represent the token IDs and the corresponding amounts that are being transferred, and they are passed to the event as `_ids` and `_values`, respectively.
