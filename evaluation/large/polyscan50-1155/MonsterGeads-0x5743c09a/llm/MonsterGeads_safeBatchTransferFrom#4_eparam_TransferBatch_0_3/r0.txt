YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred, and the event is emitted with the `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_ids`, and `_values` (amounts) parameters as required by the rule. The event is emitted just after the for loop that updates the balances for each token ID and amount, and before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook and the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function are called.
