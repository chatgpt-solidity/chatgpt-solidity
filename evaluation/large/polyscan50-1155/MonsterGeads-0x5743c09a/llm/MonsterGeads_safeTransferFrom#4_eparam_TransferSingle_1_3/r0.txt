The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `_id` argument which represents the token type being transferred. The event is emitted after the balance update and before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook and the `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` function are called. The event signature matches the rule provided:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

Here, `id` is the token type being transferred, which is required by the rule.
