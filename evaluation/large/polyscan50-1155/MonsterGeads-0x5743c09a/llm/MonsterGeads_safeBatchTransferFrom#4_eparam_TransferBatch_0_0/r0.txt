The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the current message sender (`msg.sender`). This is the expected behavior as per the rule, which states that the `_operator` must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, and it should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This gets the msg.sender

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts); // Emitting the event with the correct _operator

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function calls `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, which in turn emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `operator` set to the value of `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function is a part of the `Context` contract, which typically returns `msg.sender`, satisfying the rule that the `_operator` should be the message sender or an approved account/contract.
