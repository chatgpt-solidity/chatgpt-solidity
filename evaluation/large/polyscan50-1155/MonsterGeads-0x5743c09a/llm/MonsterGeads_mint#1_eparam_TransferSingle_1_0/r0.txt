YES

The `_mint` function within the `MonsterGeads` contract calls the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which in turn emits the `TransferSingle` event. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is a function from the `Context` contract that returns `msg.sender`. This means that the `_operator` is indeed the address that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender` according to the rule provided.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This is the _operator for the event, and it is set to msg.sender
    uint256[] memory ids = _asSingletonArray(id);
    uint256[] memory amounts = _asSingletonArray(amount);

    _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount); // The event is emitted with _operator as msg.sender

    _afterTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
}
```

The `mint` function in the `MonsterGeads` contract does not modify the `operator` before calling `_mint`, so the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_operator` being the `msg.sender`, which complies with the given rule.
