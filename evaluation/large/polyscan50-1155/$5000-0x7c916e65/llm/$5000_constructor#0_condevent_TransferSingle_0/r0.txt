NO

The provided Solidity code snippets include constructors for initializing contracts with certain values, but there is no explicit condition related to the transfer of tokens, including zero value transfers, minting, or burning within the constructors or the functions provided. The constructors are used to set initial values such as the owner of the contract, the URI for tokens, and the base token URI, name, and symbol for a specific contract instance. The condition you're asking about would typically be found in functions that handle token transfers, minting, or burning, which are not present in the given code excerpts.
