YES

The `_safeTransferFrom` function within the `ERC1155` contract correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_operator` argument set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function is designed to return the address of the sender of the message (transaction), which is typically `msg.sender`. This is the expected behavior according to the rule provided.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This gets the msg.sender (the operator)

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount); // The event is emitted with the correct operator

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `safeTransferFrom` public function, which is the external interface that calls `_safeTransferFrom`, ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an approved operator:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
    );
    _safeTransferFrom(from, to, id, amount, data);
}
```

This check ensures that the `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event will always be an address that is approved to make the transfer, satisfying the given rule.
