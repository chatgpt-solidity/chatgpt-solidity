The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted after the recipient's balance is updated with the new amount, ensuring that the `_to` argument reflects the address with the increased balance.
