The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred, and the event is emitted with the appropriate parameters, including `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_ids`, and `_values` (which is referred to as `amounts` in the function parameters).

The relevant part of the code is:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This line is called within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which is called by the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. The `ids` array represents the list of token IDs being transferred, and the `amounts` array represents the corresponding amounts for each token ID. The `operator` is the address that initiated the transfer (which is the message sender), `from` is the address from which the tokens are being transferred, and `to` is the address to which the tokens are being transferred. This matches the rule provided for the `TransferBatch` event.
