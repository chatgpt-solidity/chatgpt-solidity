YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function checks if the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or an approved operator for the token owner before proceeding with the transfer. This is done by the following line:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

If the caller is not the token owner, the function checks if the caller is approved for all by the token owner using the `isApprovedForAll` function.

The `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function is then called, which performs the actual transfer. At the end of this function, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `_operator` argument being the address of the account that initiated the transfer (which is the `msg.sender`):

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
...
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This behavior aligns with the given rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer and should be `msg.sender`. Therefore, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
