The `_mint` function within the `airdrop` function is called with the `coinbase` variable as the `_id` argument, which represents the token type being transferred. The `_mint` function is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id`, assign them to `to`, and emit a `TransferSingle` event.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted within the `_mint` function with the following arguments:

- `_operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
- `_from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred, which is set to the zero address (`address(0)`) to indicate minting.
- `_to`: The address to which the tokens are being minted.
- `_id`: The token type being transferred, which is the `coinbase` variable in this case.
- `_value`: The number of tokens being transferred, which is set to `1`.

Since the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `coinbase` variable as the `_id` argument, and `coinbase` represents the token type, the rule is satisfied.
