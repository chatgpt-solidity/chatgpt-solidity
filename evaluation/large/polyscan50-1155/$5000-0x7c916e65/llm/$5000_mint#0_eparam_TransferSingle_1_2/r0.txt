YES

The `_mint` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the `to` parameter of the `_mint` function, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the minting operation. The `_from` argument is set to the zero address, which is consistent with the ERC-1155 standard for minting operations (indicating that tokens are created rather than transferred from another address).

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ...

    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    // ...
}
```

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `to` parameter as the `_to` argument, satisfying the rule that "_The `_to` argument MUST be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased._"
