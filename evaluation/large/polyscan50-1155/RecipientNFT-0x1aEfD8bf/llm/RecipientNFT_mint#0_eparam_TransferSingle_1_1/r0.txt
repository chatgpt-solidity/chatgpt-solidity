NO

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the context of minting new tokens, there is no "from" address whose balance is being decreased because new tokens are being created, not transferred from an existing holder. In the provided `_mint` function, the `_from` argument is correctly set to the zero address (`address(0)`) when emitting the `TransferSingle` event, which is the standard way to represent minting in the ERC-1155 token standard.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument to indicate that tokens are being minted to the `_to` address, not transferred from an existing balance. This is in line with the ERC-1155 standard for minting new tokens.
