The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_id` argument is indeed the token type being transferred, as specified in the rule. The `_mint` function is called within the `airdrop` function for each recipient that is not a contract, and the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `id` parameter being passed as the `coinbase` variable, which represents the token type. The `_value` is set to `1`, which is the amount of tokens being minted and transferred to the recipient.
