The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the `operator` variable as the `_operator` argument. The `operator` variable is assigned the value of `_msgSender()` which is a function that returns `msg.sender`, the address of the account that initiated the transaction. This is in accordance with the rule that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which should be `msg.sender`. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly according to the given rule.
