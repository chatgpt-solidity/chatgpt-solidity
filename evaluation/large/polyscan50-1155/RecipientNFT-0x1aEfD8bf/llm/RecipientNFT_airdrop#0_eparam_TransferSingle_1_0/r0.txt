The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function, which is called within the `airdrop` function. The `_mint` function is defined to emit the `TransferSingle` event whenever new tokens are created and assigned to an address.

The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the context of the transaction. Since the `airdrop` function can only be called by the owner of the contract (due to the `onlyOwner` modifier), the `_operator` will be the owner's address, which is an account approved to make the transfer.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule, with `_operator` being the address that is approved to make the transfer (in this case, the owner of the contract, which should be `msg.sender`).
