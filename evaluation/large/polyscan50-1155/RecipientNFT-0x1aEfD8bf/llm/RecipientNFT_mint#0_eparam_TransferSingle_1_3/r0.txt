The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_id` argument is indeed the token type being transferred, as specified by the `id` parameter in the `_mint` function call. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `operator` (the message sender), `from` address (which is `address(0)` since it's a mint operation), `to` address (the recipient of the minted tokens), `id` (the token type), and `amount` (the number of tokens minted).
