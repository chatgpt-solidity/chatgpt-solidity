YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (other code for checks and balance updates)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (other code for balance transfer logic)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (other code for post-transfer checks)
}
```

The `emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);` line is where the event is emitted. The `to` variable is used as the `_to` argument in the event, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the batch transfer. This matches the rule provided.
