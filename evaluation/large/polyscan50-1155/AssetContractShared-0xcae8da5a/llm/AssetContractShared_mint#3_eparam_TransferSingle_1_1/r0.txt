The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155Tradable` contract with the `_from` argument set to `address(0)`. This is the correct behavior for a mint operation, as minting new tokens increases the balance of the `_to` address from a zero address (which represents the token creation). The zero address (`address(0)`) is used to indicate that the tokens are being minted rather than transferred from an existing holder, which complies with the rule that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. In the case of minting, there is no holder from whom the tokens are being taken, hence the use of `address(0)` is appropriate.
