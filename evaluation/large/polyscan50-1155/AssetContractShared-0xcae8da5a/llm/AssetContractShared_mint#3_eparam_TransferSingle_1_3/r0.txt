The `mint` function in the `AssetContractShared` contract calls the `_mint` function, which in turn emits the `TransferSingle` event. The `_id` argument passed to the `mint` function is used throughout the call stack and is ultimately used as the `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event, satisfying the rule that "_id argument MUST be the token type being transferred."

Here's the call stack that leads to the emission of the `TransferSingle` event:

1. `mint` function is called with `_id` as one of its parameters.
2. `mint` function calls `_mint` with the same `_id`.
3. `_mint` function in `ERC1155Tradable` emits the `TransferSingle` event using the `_id` received from the `mint` function.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_id` argument that was passed to the `mint` function, which is the token type being transferred. Therefore, the given rule is followed.
