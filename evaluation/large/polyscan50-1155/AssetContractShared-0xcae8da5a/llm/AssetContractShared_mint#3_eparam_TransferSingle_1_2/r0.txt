The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155Tradable` contract with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_to` argument in the event is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `_mint` function. The `_mint` function is called by the `mint` function in the `AssetContractShared` contract, which is the only place where `_mint` is called, ensuring that the `_to` argument is indeed the recipient's address.
