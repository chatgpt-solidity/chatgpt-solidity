The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the `AssetContract` contract calls `safeTransferFrom` for each pair of token ID and amount. However, the `safeTransferFrom` function in the `AssetContract` contract has been overridden to potentially mint new tokens if the `_from` address does not have enough balance of the token ID being transferred.

Here's the relevant part of the overridden `safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _id,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes memory _data
) public override {
    uint256 mintedBalance = super.balanceOf(_from, _id);
    if (mintedBalance < _amount) {
        // Only mint what _from doesn't already have
        mint(_to, _id, _amount - mintedBalance, _data);
        if (mintedBalance > 0) {
            super.safeTransferFrom(_from, _to, _id, mintedBalance, _data);
        }
    } else {
        super.safeTransferFrom(_from, _to, _id, _amount, _data);
    }
}
```

In the case where `_from` does not have enough balance, the contract will mint the difference directly to `_to`, and if `_from` has a non-zero balance, it will transfer that amount to `_to`. This means that the `TransferSingle` event could be emitted with a `_from` address that is not the actual holder of the tokens being transferred (since some of the tokens are minted and not transferred from `_from`), which violates the given rule.
