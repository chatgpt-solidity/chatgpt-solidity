The `safeTransferFrom` function in the `ERC1155Tradable` contract correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_value` argument representing the number of tokens transferred from the `_from` address to the `_to` address. The balances are updated accordingly before the event is emitted, ensuring that the `_value` matches the change in the holder's balance and the recipient's balance increase.

Here's the relevant part of the `safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
uint256 fromBalance = balances[id][from];
require(
    fromBalance >= amount,
    "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer"
);
balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
balances[id][to] += amount;

emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

The `amount` is subtracted from the `from` balance and added to the `to` balance, and then the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `amount` as the `_value`, which adheres to the given rule.
