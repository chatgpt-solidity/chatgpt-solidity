The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_batchMint` function of the `ERC1155Tradable` contract with the correct arguments according to the rule provided. The `_to` argument in the event is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the minting process. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and before the `doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called, which ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the tokens.
