YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the `ERC1155Tradable` contract emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_id` argument being the token type being transferred. The function signature for `safeTransferFrom` is as follows:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
)
```

Within this function, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the exact `_id` that was passed as an argument to the function:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

This confirms that the `_id` used in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the token type being transferred, which complies with the given rule.
