YES

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155Tradable` contract with the `_value` argument set to the `_amount` parameter of the `_mint` function. This `_amount` represents the number of tokens that are being minted and transferred to the `_to` address. The balance of the `_to` address is increased by `_amount` as shown in the line `balances[_id][_to] += _amount;`, and since there is no `_from` address in the case of minting (as tokens are being created), the `_from` address is set to `address(0)` indicating that the tokens are coming from the zero address (i.e., they are being minted).

The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event matches the number of tokens the recipient balance is increased by, which is consistent with the given rule.
