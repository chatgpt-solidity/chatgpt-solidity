The `migrate` function in the `AssetContractShared` contract is designed to transfer tokens from the old contract to the new one. However, the `_mint` function is called within the `migrate` function to mint new tokens to the owner's address. The `_mint` function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_from` argument set to the zero address (address(0)), which represents a minting operation rather than a transfer from an existing holder.

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, but in the case of minting, there is no holder from whom the balance is decreased. The balance is simply increased for the `_to` address, and the `_from` address is the zero address to indicate that tokens are being created, not transferred from another address.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is not emitted according to the given rule in the context of the `migrate` function, as it is a minting operation rather than a transfer from an existing balance.
