The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155Tradable` contract, which is called by the `migrate` function in the `AssetContractShared` contract. The `_mint` function takes `_id` as an argument, which represents the token type being transferred. The event is emitted with the `_id` argument passed to the `_mint` function, thus satisfying the rule that "_id argument MUST be the token type being transferred."

Here is the relevant part of the code from the `_mint` function:

```solidity
function _mint(
    address _to,
    uint256 _id,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes memory _data
) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... other code ...

    balances[_id][_to] += _amount;
    _supply[_id] += _amount;

    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), _to, _id, _amount);

    // ... other code ...
}
```

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct `_id` argument, which is the token type being transferred.
