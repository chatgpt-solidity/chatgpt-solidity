The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155Tradable` contract with the correct arguments. The `_to` argument is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, which is in line with the given rule.

Here is the relevant part of the `_mint` function where the `TransferSingle` event is emitted:

```solidity
function _mint(
    address _to,
    uint256 _id,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes memory _data
) internal virtual override whenNotPaused {
    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (other code)

    balances[_id][_to] += _amount;
    _supply[_id] += _amount;

    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), _to, _id, _amount);

    // ... (other code)
}
```

In the `migrate` function of the `AssetContractShared` contract, the `_mint` function is called with the `owner` as the `_to` argument, which is the recipient whose balance should be increased:

```solidity
function migrate(Ownership[] memory _ownerships) public onlyOwnerOrProxy {
    // ... (other code)

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _ownerships.length; ++i) {
        uint256 id = _ownerships[i].id;
        address owner = _ownerships[i].owner;

        // ... (other code)

        uint256 previousAmount = _migrationTarget.balanceOf(owner, id);

        if (previousAmount == 0) {
            continue;
        }

        _mint(owner, id, previousAmount, "");

        // ... (other code)
    }
}
```

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
