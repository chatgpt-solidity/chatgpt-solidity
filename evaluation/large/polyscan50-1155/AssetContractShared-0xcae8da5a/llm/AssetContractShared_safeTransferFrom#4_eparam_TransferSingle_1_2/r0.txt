The `safeTransferFrom` function in the `ERC1155Tradable` contract emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This is in accordance with the given rule.

Here is the relevant part of the `safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override whenNotPaused onlyApproved(from) {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: transfer to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (omitted for brevity)

    uint256 fromBalance = balances[id][from];
    require(
        fromBalance >= amount,
        "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer"
    );
    balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    balances[id][to] += amount;

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);

    // ... (omitted for brevity)
}
```

As you can see, the `balances[id][to]` is increased by `amount` before the `TransferSingle` event is emitted, and the `_to` parameter in the event corresponds to the `to` argument of the function, which is the recipient's address.
