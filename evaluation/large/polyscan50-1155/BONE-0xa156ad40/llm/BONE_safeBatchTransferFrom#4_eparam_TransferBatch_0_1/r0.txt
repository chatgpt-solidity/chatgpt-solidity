YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_from` argument in the event is indeed the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is ensured by the following lines of code:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();

...

for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}

emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `from` variable is used to decrease the balance of the token holder, and the same `from` variable is passed as the `_from` argument to the `TransferBatch` event, satisfying the rule that "_The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased._"
