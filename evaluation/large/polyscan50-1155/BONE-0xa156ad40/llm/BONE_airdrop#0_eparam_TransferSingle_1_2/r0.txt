The `airdrop` function in the `BONE` contract calls the `_mint` function for each recipient in the `recipients` array, provided that the recipient is not a contract (checked by the `isContract` function). The `_mint` function, as defined in the `ERC1155` contract, emits the `TransferSingle` event with the appropriate arguments, including the `_to` argument which is set to the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The `_mint` function is called with the `to` parameter being the recipient's address, the `id` parameter being the `_currentTokenId`, and the `amount` parameter being `1`. This matches the rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
