The `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly according to the given rule. In the `_mint` function, the `_from` argument is set to `address(0)` which is the correct representation for minting operations, indicating that the tokens are created out of thin air and not transferred from an existing holder. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `operator` as the `_operator`, `address(0)` as the `_from`, `to` as the `_to`, `id` as the `_id`, and `amount` as the `_value`. This follows the ERC-1155 standard for minting new tokens.
