YES

The `_mint` function in the provided contract code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument passed to the `TransferSingle` event is obtained from the `id` parameter of the `_mint` function, which represents the token type being transferred. The `amount` parameter represents the `_value` argument in the event, which is the number of tokens of type `id` being minted and transferred to the `to` address.

The relevant line in the `_mint` function is:
```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```
This line shows that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct arguments, including the `id` as the token type (`_id`) and `amount` as the number of tokens transferred (`_value`). The `operator` is the one performing the operation, `_from` is the zero address (since tokens are being minted), `_to` is the recipient address, and the `id` and `amount` are the token type and the number of tokens minted, respectively.
