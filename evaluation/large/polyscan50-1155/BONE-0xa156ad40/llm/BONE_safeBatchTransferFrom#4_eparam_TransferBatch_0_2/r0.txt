YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and before the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function is called. The `_to` argument in the event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule. The event is emitted with the correct parameters, including the `_operator` (the address performing the transfer), `_from` (the address of the sender), `_to` (the address of the recipient), `_ids` (the array of token IDs), and `_values` (the array of transfer amounts corresponding to the token IDs).
