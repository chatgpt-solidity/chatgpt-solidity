The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the context of minting new tokens, there is no "from" address whose balance is decreased because new tokens are being created, not transferred from an existing holder. In the `_mint` function, the `from` address is set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which is a common convention to denote minting in ERC-1155 and similar token standards.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_from` argument, which is correct for a minting operation. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted correctly according to the standard practice for minting operations, but it does not follow the given rule if the rule is interpreted strictly to mean that `_from` must always be an existing token holder. However, the rule does not apply to minting operations, so the event is emitted correctly in the context of the `_mint` function.
