The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the `Context` contract. This is the expected behavior as per the rule, which states that the `_operator` must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, and it should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `safeTransferFrom` function calls `_safeTransferFrom`, which then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator` set to the result of `_msgSender()`. The `_msgSender()` function is a part of the `Context` contract and returns the `msg.sender`, which is the address of the entity that invoked the function. This ensures that the `_operator` in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address that is approved to make the transfer.
