YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the tokens or an approved operator for the `from` address by using the `require` statement:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

If this requirement is met, the `_safeTransferFrom` internal function is called, which performs the actual transfer. Within `_safeTransferFrom`, the `operator` variable is set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` of the transaction:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
```

Later in the `_safeTransferFrom` function, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `operator` as the first argument:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);
```

Since the `operator` is set to the `msg.sender` that has been previously checked to be approved for the transfer, the `TransferSingle` event is correctly emitted according to the given rule.
