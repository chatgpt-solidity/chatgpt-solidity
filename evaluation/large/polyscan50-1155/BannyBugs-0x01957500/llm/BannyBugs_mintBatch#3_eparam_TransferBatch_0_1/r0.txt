The `_mintBatch` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to mint a batch of tokens to a specified address. According to the ERC-1155 standard, minting is represented as a transfer from the zero address. In the context of the `TransferBatch` event, the `_from` argument should be the address from which the tokens are transferred. When minting, this is the zero address, as new tokens are created rather than transferred from an existing holder.

The relevant part of the `_mintBatch` function that emits the `TransferBatch` event is as follows:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts);
```

Here, `address(0)` is used as the `_from` argument, which is correct for a minting operation according to the ERC-1155 standard. The `to` argument is the address of the recipient receiving the newly minted tokens, `ids` is the array of token IDs, and `amounts` is the array of quantities for each token ID being minted.

Since the `_from` argument is correctly set to the zero address for the minting operation, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted according to the given rule.
