YES

The provided Solidity function `_mint` within the `ERC1155` contract correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the token type being transferred (minted in this case). The `_mint` function constructs the `ids` array with a single element, which is the token type `id`, and then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `id` as the `_id` argument, satisfying the rule.
