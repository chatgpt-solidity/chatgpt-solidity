The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burn` function, the `_to` argument is set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which indicates that tokens are being burned (destroyed) rather than transferred to a recipient. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with `address(0)` as the `_to` argument, which does not increase the balance of any recipient but rather decreases the balance of the `_from` address by the amount of tokens burned. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is not emitted according to the given rule when the `_burn` function is called.
