The `burnBatch` function in the `ERC1155Burnable` contract calls the `_burnBatch` function in the `ERC1155` contract. The `_burnBatch` function emits the `TransferBatch` event with the `from` parameter set to the address from which the tokens are being burned, which is the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. This is in accordance with the given rule that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. The `to` parameter is set to the zero address, indicating that the tokens are being burned (removed from circulation), which is standard for a burn operation.
