YES

The `_mint` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to create (`amount`) tokens of token type (`id`), and assign them to the address (`to`). According to the ERC-1155 standard, when minting new tokens, the `_from` argument in the `TransferSingle` event should be the zero address, indicating that the tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder.

In the `_mint` function, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `from` parameter set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which is correct as per the rule provided. The `to` parameter is set to the address that receives the newly minted tokens, the `id` parameter is set to the token type being minted, and the `amount` parameter is set to the number of tokens being minted.

Here is the relevant line from the `_mint` function that emits the `TransferSingle` event:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```

This line correctly indicates that the tokens are being minted (as `from` is the zero address) and assigned to the `to` address. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
