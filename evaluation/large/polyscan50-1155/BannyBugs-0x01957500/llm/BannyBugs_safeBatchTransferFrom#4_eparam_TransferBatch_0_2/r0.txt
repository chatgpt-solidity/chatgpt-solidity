The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `_to` argument which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The event is emitted after the balances have been updated and before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook is called, which is consistent with the rule provided.
