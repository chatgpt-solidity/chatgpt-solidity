The `_mint` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_value` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to `amount`, which is the number of tokens that are being minted and assigned to the `to` address. The `_balances[id][to]` mapping is increased by `amount`, which matches the increase in the recipient's balance. The `_from` address is set to the zero address, indicating that tokens are being minted rather than transferred from an existing holder.

Here's the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender();
    uint256[] memory ids = _asSingletonArray(id);
    uint256[] memory amounts = _asSingletonArray(amount);

    _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _afterTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
}
```

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_operator` as the operator who initiated the minting, `_from` as the zero address (since tokens are being minted), `_to` as the recipient address, `_id` as the token type, and `_value` as the amount of tokens minted. This complies with the rule that the `_value` must match the number of tokens the recipient's balance is increased by.
