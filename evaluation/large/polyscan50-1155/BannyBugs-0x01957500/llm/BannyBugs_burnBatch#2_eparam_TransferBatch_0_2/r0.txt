NO

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted in the `_burnBatch` function with the `_to` argument set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which indicates that tokens are being burned (removed from circulation). According to the rule provided, the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the case of burning tokens, there is no recipient whose balance is increased; instead, the balance is decreased as the tokens are destroyed. Therefore, the event does not follow the given rule.
