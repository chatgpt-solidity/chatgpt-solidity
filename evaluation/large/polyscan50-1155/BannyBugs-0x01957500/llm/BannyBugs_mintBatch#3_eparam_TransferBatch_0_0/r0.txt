The `mintBatch` function in the `BannyBugs` contract calls `_mintBatch`, which in turn emits the `TransferBatch` event. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the same as `msg.sender` in the `Context` contract. This means that the `_operator` argument is indeed the address of the account that is making the transfer, which is the expected behavior according to the given rule.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mintBatch(
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ...
    address operator = _msgSender(); // This is equivalent to msg.sender

    // ...

    emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts); // Emitting the event with the operator as msg.sender

    // ...
}
```

The `mintBatch` function is also protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the owner of the contract can call this function, which is consistent with the rule that the operator should be approved to make the transfer. Since the owner is by default approved to make transfers, the rule is followed.
