The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract is designed to create `amount` tokens of token type `id`, and assign them to the `to` address. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted within this function, with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, which is the `to` parameter passed to the `_mint` function.

Here is the relevant part of the `_mint` function:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender();
    uint256[] memory ids = _asSingletonArray(id);
    uint256[] memory amounts = _asSingletonArray(amount);

    _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _afterTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
}
```

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `to` address as the `_to` argument, which is the recipient of the minted tokens. Therefore, the event `TransferSingle` is emitted according to the given rule.
