The `mintBatch` function in the `BannyBugs` contract calls the `_mintBatch` internal function, which in turn emits the `TransferBatch` event. The `_to` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the `to` parameter passed to the `_mintBatch` function, which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. This is in accordance with the given rule that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _mintBatch(
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");
    require(ids.length == amounts.length, "ERC1155: ids and amounts length mismatch");

    address operator = _msgSender();

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `to` parameter as the `_to` argument, which is the correct recipient address. Therefore, the event `TransferBatch` is emitted according to the given rule.
