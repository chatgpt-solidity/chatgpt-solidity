YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the account that initiated the transaction (equivalent to `msg.sender` in the absence of meta-transactions).

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function checks that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the tokens (`from`) or an approved operator for the owner's account before proceeding with the transfer. This is done by the `require` statement:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

After this check, the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function is called, which performs the actual transfer and emits the `TransferBatch` event:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

Here, `operator` is set to the value of `address operator = _msgSender();`, which is the correct implementation according to the rule that the `_operator` must be the address that is approved to make the transfer.
