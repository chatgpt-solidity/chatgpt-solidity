The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_safeTransferFrom` function with the correct arguments, including the `_to` argument which is the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The event is emitted after the balance update logic, which ensures that the recipient's balance (`_balances[id][to]`) is increased by the `amount` before the event is emitted.
