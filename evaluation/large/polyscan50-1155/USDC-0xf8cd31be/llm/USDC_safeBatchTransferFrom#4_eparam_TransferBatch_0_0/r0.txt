YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function checks if the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or approved for all by the token owner to make the transfer. This is done by the `require` statement:

```solidity
require(
    from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
    "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
);
```

If the caller is not the token owner or approved, the function will revert. If the caller passes this check, the function proceeds to call `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, which performs the actual transfer.

Inside `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, the `operator` variable is set to the result of `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender`:

```solidity
address operator = _msgSender();
```

This `operator` is then used as the `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

Since the `operator` is set to `msg.sender` and the `msg.sender` has already been verified to be approved to make the transfer, the event `TransferBatch` is emitted with the `_operator` argument being the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, which complies with the given rule.
