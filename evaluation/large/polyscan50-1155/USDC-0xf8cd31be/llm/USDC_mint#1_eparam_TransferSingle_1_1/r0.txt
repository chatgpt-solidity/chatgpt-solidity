NO

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. However, in the context of minting new tokens, there is no "from" address whose balance is being decreased because new tokens are being created, not transferred from an existing holder. In the provided `_mint` function, the `_from` argument is set to `address(0)` when emitting the `TransferSingle` event, which is a convention used to indicate that tokens are being minted:

```solidity
emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);
```

This is the correct behavior for a mint operation according to the ERC-1155 standard, which specifies that when minting, the `_from` field should be the zero address to indicate that tokens are being created rather than transferred from another address.
