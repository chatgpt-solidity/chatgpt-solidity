The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule. The relevant line in the code is:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This line is called after the balances have been updated for each `id` in the `ids` array, ensuring that the `_to` address is the recipient of the tokens. The `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct parameters, including the `_to` address, which matches the `to` variable in the function, representing the recipient of the transfer.
