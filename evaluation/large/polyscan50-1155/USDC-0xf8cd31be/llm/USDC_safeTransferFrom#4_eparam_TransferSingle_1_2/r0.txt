The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_to` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the address of the recipient whose balance is increased by the `_safeTransferFrom` function. The event is emitted after the balance update and before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook is called, ensuring that the recipient's balance has been increased as per the transfer operation.
