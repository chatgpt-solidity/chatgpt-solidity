The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and must match what the recipient's balance is increased by, corresponding to the list and order of tokens specified in `_ids`.

In the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which is called by `safeBatchTransferFrom`, there is a loop that iterates over the `ids` and `amounts` arrays:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}
```

This loop ensures that for each token ID (`id`) in the `ids` array, the corresponding amount (`amount`) in the `amounts` array is subtracted from the sender's (`from`) balance and added to the recipient's (`to`) balance. The `require` statement ensures that the sender has enough balance to transfer the specified amount of tokens.

After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the operator, from, to, ids, and amounts:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `ids` and `amounts` arrays are used as the `_ids` and `_values` arguments in the event, respectively, which satisfies the rule that the `_values` must match the changes in the holder's and recipient's balances for the corresponding token IDs.
