The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with a hardcoded value of `1` for the `_value` argument. The rule states that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by. However, the function `airdrop` does not actually transfer any tokens or change any balances; it only emits the event. There is no code in the provided function that interacts with the balances of the addresses involved.

For the event to be emitted correctly according to the rule, the function should include logic to transfer `_id` tokens from the `from` address to each address in the `to` array, and the `_value` in the `TransferSingle` event should reflect the actual number of tokens transferred. Since this logic is missing, the event does not accurately represent a token transfer, and thus does not comply with the given rule.
