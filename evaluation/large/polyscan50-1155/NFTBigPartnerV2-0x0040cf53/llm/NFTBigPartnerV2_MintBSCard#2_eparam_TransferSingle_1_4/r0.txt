The `_mint` function in the `ERC1155` contract is designed to create (`amount`) tokens of token type (`id`), and assign them to (`to`). It emits a `TransferSingle` event as part of its operation.

The `MintBSCard` function in the `NFTBigPartnerV2` contract calls `_mint` with the appropriate arguments, including the number of tokens to mint (`_cardsNum`) and the token type (`_n`). The `_mint` function then emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_value` argument set to the `amount` of tokens minted, which is `_cardsNum`. This matches the increase in the recipient's balance, as required by the rule.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule, with the `_value` argument reflecting the correct number of tokens transferred.
