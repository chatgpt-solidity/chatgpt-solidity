YES

In the provided Solidity code, the `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract is responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to a recipient address (`to`). The `_mint` function emits a `TransferSingle` event as part of its operation.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:
- `operator`: The address which initiated the minting (usually the message sender).
- `from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred. In the case of minting, this is the zero address (`address(0)`), as new tokens are being created rather than transferred from an existing holder.
- `to`: The address to which the tokens are being minted.
- `id`: The token type identifier.
- `amount`: The number of tokens being minted.

The `HelpMembertoMintCard` function in the `NFTBigPartnerV2` contract calls the `_mint` function to mint new tokens. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_from` argument set to the zero address, which is correct according to the rule provided, as the zero address represents the creation of new tokens rather than a decrease in balance from an existing holder.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule, and the answer is "YES".
