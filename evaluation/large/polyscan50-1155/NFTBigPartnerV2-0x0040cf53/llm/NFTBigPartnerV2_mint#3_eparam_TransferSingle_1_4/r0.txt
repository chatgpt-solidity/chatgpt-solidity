The provided Solidity code includes the `_mint` function within the `ERC1155` contract, which is responsible for creating (`minting`) new tokens of a specific token type (`id`) and assigning them to a recipient address (`to`). The `_mint` function is called from the `mint` function in the `NFTBigPartnerV2` contract.

The `_mint` function performs the following steps:
1. It checks that the recipient address (`to`) is not the zero address.
2. It sets the `operator` to the message sender (`_msgSender()`).
3. It creates singleton arrays for the `id` and `amount` to be used in the token transfer hooks.
4. It calls `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook before the actual token transfer logic.
5. It increases the balance of the recipient (`_balances[id][to]`) by the `amount`.
6. It emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `operator`, `from` address (which is zero in the case of minting), `to` address, `id`, and `amount`.
7. It calls `_afterTokenTransfer` hook after the token transfer logic.
8. It performs a safe transfer acceptance check if the recipient is a contract.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_value` argument set to the `amount` of tokens minted for the recipient, which matches the increase in the recipient's balance. This complies with the given rule that the `_value` argument must be the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by (in the case of minting, the "holder" is the zero address, so the balance is not decreased but rather created) and match what the recipient's balance is increased by.

Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
