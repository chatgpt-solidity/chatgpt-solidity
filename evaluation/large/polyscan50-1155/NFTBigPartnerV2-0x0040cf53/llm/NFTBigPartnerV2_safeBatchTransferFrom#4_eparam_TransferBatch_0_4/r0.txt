The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The rule states that the `_values` argument must be the list of the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and must match what the recipient's balance is increased by. This is consistent with the behavior of the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` internal function, which is called by `safeBatchTransferFrom`.

In the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function, there is a loop that iterates over the `ids` and `amounts` arrays:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
    uint256 id = ids[i];
    uint256 amount = amounts[i];

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: insufficient balance for transfer");
    unchecked {
        _balances[id][from] = fromBalance - amount;
    }
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
}
```

This loop ensures that for each token ID (`id`) in the `ids` array, the corresponding amount (`amount`) in the `amounts` array is subtracted from the `from` address's balance and added to the `to` address's balance. This satisfies the rule that the `_values` argument (which is the `amounts` array in this case) must reflect the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by.

After updating the balances, the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the `operator`, `from`, `to`, `ids`, and `amounts`:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

The `amounts` array is used as the `_values` argument in the `TransferBatch` event, which complies with the rule provided.
