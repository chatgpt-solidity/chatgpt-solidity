YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferSingle` event according to the given rule. The `_id` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is indeed the token type being transferred, as required by the rule.

Here's the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferSingle(operator, from, to, id, amount);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `id` parameter passed to `_safeTransferFrom` is used directly in the `TransferSingle` event emission, satisfying the rule that "_id argument MUST be the token type being transferred."
