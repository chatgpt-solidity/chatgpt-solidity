The `_burn` function within the `ERC1155` contract emits the `TransferSingle` event after performing the necessary checks and balance updates. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferSingle` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the `msg.sender` in the `Context` contract. This is the correct implementation according to the rule provided, as the `_operator` should be the address that is approved to make the transfer, which in the context of the `_burn` function, is the `msg.sender`.

Additionally, the `burn` function in the `ERC1155Burnable` contract ensures that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the token owner or an approved operator for the `account` before calling `_burn`. This further enforces the rule that the `_operator` must be approved to make the transfer.
