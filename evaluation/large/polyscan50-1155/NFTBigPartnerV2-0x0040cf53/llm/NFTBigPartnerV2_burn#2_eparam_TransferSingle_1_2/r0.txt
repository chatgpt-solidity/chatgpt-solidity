The rule states that the `_to` argument must be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. However, in the context of the `_burn` function, the `_to` argument is set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which indicates that tokens are being burned (destroyed) rather than transferred to a recipient. Therefore, the balance of the `_to` address is not increased; instead, the balance of the `_from` address is decreased by the amount of tokens burned. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the `_to` argument as the zero address, which does not comply with the given rule.
