YES

The `_burn` function in the `ERC1155` contract is designed to destroy (`burn`) a certain `amount` of tokens of a specific token type `id` from the `from` address. The function checks that the `from` address is not the zero address and that the `from` address has enough tokens of the specified `id` to burn the requested `amount`.

After performing the necessary checks and updating the balance, the function emits the `TransferSingle` event with the `_operator` as the caller of the function (retrieved via `_msgSender()`), the `_from` address as the address from which the tokens are burned, the `_to` address as the zero address (since tokens are being burned), the `_id` as the token type, and the `_value` as the amount of tokens burned.

The rule states that the `_from` argument must be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased, which is indeed the case in the `_burn` function. The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct `_from` address as required by the rule. Therefore, the answer is "YES", the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
