The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_operator` argument in the `TransferBatch` event is set to the address returned by `_msgSender()`, which is the current message sender (`msg.sender`). This is the expected behavior as per the rule, which states that the `_operator` must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer, and it should be `msg.sender`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    address operator = _msgSender(); // This gets the msg.sender

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts); // Emitting the event with the correct _operator

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

And the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, which is the external interface that calls `_safeBatchTransferFrom`, ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an approved operator:

```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override {
    require(
        from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
        "ERC1155: caller is not token owner or approved"
    );
    _safeBatchTransferFrom(from, to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

This code checks that the `msg.sender` is either the owner of the tokens (`from == _msgSender()`) or an approved operator (`isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender())`). If this requirement is met, `_safeBatchTransferFrom` is called, which then emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct `_operator` as per the rule.
