The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_mint` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which is called by the `HelpMembertoMintCard` function in the `NFTBigPartnerV2` contract. The `_mint` function is designed to create `_amount` tokens of token type `_id`, and assign them to the address `to`. The event `TransferSingle` is emitted with the `_value` argument set to the `amount` of tokens minted, which is the number of tokens the recipient's balance is increased by. Since the `from` address in a mint operation is the zero address (indicating token creation), the `_value` argument correctly represents the number of tokens created and assigned to the `to` address, thus adhering to the given rule.
