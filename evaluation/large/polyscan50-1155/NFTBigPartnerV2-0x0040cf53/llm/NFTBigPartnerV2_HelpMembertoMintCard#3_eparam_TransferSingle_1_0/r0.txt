The `HelpMembertoMintCard` function in the `NFTBigPartnerV2` contract calls the `_mint` function from the `ERC1155` contract. The `_mint` function is responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to a recipient address (`to`). As part of the minting process, the `_mint` function emits a `TransferSingle` event.

The `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the following arguments:
- `operator`: The address performing the mint operation, which is set to the result of `_msgSender()` in the `_mint` function. The `_msgSender()` function is designed to return the `msg.sender`, which is the address that initiated the transaction.
- `from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred. In the case of minting, this is the zero address (`address(0)`), as new tokens are being created.
- `to`: The recipient address for the newly minted tokens.
- `id`: The token type identifier.
- `amount`: The number of tokens being minted.

The rule states that the `_operator` argument must be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer and should be `msg.sender`. In the provided code, the `operator` is indeed set to the `msg.sender` by using the `_msgSender()` function within the `_mint` function. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event is emitted according to the given rule.
