The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The `_ids` argument is indeed the list of tokens being transferred, and the event is emitted with the appropriate parameters: `_operator`, `_from`, `_to`, `_ids`, and `_values` (which corresponds to `amounts` in the function).

The relevant part of the code is:

```solidity
emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);
```

This line is called within the `_safeBatchTransferFrom` function after the balances have been updated and before the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook and the `_doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck` function are called. The parameters passed to the event match the expected format of the `TransferBatch` event as per the rule provided.
