YES

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly emits the `TransferBatch` event according to the given rule. The event is emitted with the `_to` argument being the address of the recipient whose balance is increased, as required by the rule.

Here is the relevant part of the code that confirms this:

```solidity
function _safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual {
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
        uint256 id = ids[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        // ... (omitted code for brevity)

        _balances[id][to] += amount;
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);

    // ... (omitted code for brevity)
}
```

The `emit TransferBatch(operator, from, to, ids, amounts);` line shows that the event is emitted with the `to` address as the recipient, which is the address whose balance is being increased by the amounts specified in the `amounts` array for the token IDs specified in the `ids` array. This matches the rule provided.
