The `TransferSingle` event is emitted in the `_burn` function of the `ERC1155` contract, which is called by the `burn` function in the `ERC1155Burnable` contract. The `_burn` function is used to destroy tokens, and the `TransferSingle` event reflects this by having the `_to` address set to the zero address, indicating that the tokens are being burned (removed from circulation), not transferred to another recipient.

The rule provided states that the `_value` argument must match the number of tokens the holder's balance is decreased by and what the recipient's balance is increased by. However, in the case of burning tokens, there is no recipient whose balance is being increased; the tokens are simply being destroyed. Therefore, the `TransferSingle` event in the context of the `_burn` function does not match the rule that the recipient's balance should be increased by the `_value`, because there is no increase in any recipient's balance when tokens are burned.

The `RedempBIGP` function in the `NFTBigPartnerV2` contract calls the `burn` function to burn tokens and then attempts to transfer the `BIGP` tokens to the `desti` address. The `TransferSingle` event related to the burning process does not involve a transfer of tokens to another recipient, so it does not follow the rule as described. The actual transfer of `BIGP` tokens is a separate action and does not emit a `TransferSingle` event.
