NO

The provided code snippet for the `transfer` function in the ERC20 contract is incomplete and does not contain any logic. It is just a function signature that returns a boolean value. Without the actual implementation of the function, it is impossible to determine whether it will throw an error or not when transferring a value of 0.

In a typical ERC20 token implementation, transferring a value of 0 would not throw an error, but this is not guaranteed without seeing the full implementation of the function. The actual behavior would depend on the code inside the `transfer` function, which is not provided in the snippet above.
