YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The function checks for sufficient allowance and deducts the appropriate fee if the `feeActive` flag is true and the amount is greater than certain thresholds. However, if the amount is 0, the fee calculation and subtraction would result in 0, and the `_transfer` function would be called with an amount of 0.

The `_transfer` function has checks to prevent transfers from and to the zero address, and to ensure that the `from` address has a sufficient balance. However, if the amount is 0, the balance check will pass (since 0 is always less than or equal to any balance), and the function will complete without reverting.

Therefore, the `transferFrom` function and its related parts will not throw an error if the transfer amount is 0.
