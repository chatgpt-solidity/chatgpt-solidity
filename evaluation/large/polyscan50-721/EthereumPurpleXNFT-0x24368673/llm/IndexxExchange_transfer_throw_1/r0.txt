The transfer function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The function checks if the `feeActive` is true and if the amount is greater than certain thresholds to calculate and deduct fees. However, if the amount is 0, none of the fee-related conditions will be met, and the function will simply attempt to perform a transfer of 0 tokens, which is a valid operation in ERC20 tokens.

The `_transfer` internal function, which is called by `transfer`, checks that the `from` and `to` addresses are not the zero address, and that the `from` address has a sufficient balance to cover the transfer amount. Since the balance check is against the transfer amount, and in this case, the amount is 0, the balance requirement is trivially satisfied (assuming the `from` address has a non-negative balance, which should always be the case).

Therefore, the transfer of a 0 value should not throw an error and will simply result in a `Transfer` event being emitted with a value of 0.
