NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly contain an action that creates a `tokenId` with an `owner` address as the owner. The code defines an `Ownable` abstract contract that manages ownership of the contract itself, not the ownership of tokens. The `ERC721` contract is a standard for non-fungible tokens, and while it does manage token ownership, the provided code snippet does not include a function that creates a new token (`tokenId`). The `transferOwnership` function in the `Ownable` contract is for transferring ownership of the contract, not individual tokens.
