YES

The `_transfer` function in the provided Solidity code has a specific check for when the `amount` being transferred is 0. If the `amount` is 0, the function calls `super._transfer(from, to, 0)` and then immediately returns, effectively bypassing any further logic that could potentially throw an error.

Here is the relevant part of the `_transfer` function:

```solidity
if (amount == 0) {
    super._transfer(from, to, 0);
    return;
}
```

This means that transfers of 0 value will not throw an error and will be processed as valid transfers with no additional effects.
