The `_transfer` function in the provided Solidity code checks if the `amount` being transferred is 0 and, if so, it simply calls `super._transfer(from, to, 0)` and returns, effectively performing a transfer of 0 tokens without throwing an error. This is a common practice to allow for events to be emitted even when no actual token transfer is taking place, which can be useful for off-chain indexing and tracking purposes.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
if (amount == 0) {
    super._transfer(from, to, 0);
    return;
}
```

This check ensures that the function will not throw an error when a transfer of 0 value is attempted.
