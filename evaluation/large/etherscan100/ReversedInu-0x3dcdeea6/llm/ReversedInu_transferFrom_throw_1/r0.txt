The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which includes checks for overflows and underflows. When transferring a value of 0, the SafeMath functions will not throw an error because:

1. The subtraction in `_approve` function will not underflow since the allowance is expected to be greater than or equal to the amount being transferred, which is 0 in this case.
2. The addition in `_transfer` function will not overflow because adding 0 to any balance will not exceed the maximum uint256 value.

Therefore, if the `transferFrom` function is called with an amount of 0, it should not throw an error due to arithmetic operations. However, it's important to note that the function has a requirement that the transfer amount must be greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This requirement will cause the function to revert if the amount is 0. So, while the arithmetic operations themselves will not throw, the function as a whole will not allow a transfer of 0 value due to this specific requirement.
