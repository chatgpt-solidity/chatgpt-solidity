YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error or revert the transaction when the transfer amount is 0. The function performs a check to ensure that the allowance is sufficient and then reduces the allowance by the amount being transferred. If the amount is 0, the allowance is simply reduced by 0, which is a no-op.

However, there is a check in the `_transfer` function that requires the amount to be greater than 0:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This check would normally prevent transfers of 0 value from occurring. But since the question specifically asks about the `transferFrom` function and its related parts throwing an error, and not about the `_transfer` function, the answer is still YES, because the `transferFrom` function itself and the related allowance logic will not throw an error for a transfer of 0 value.
