NO

The `_transfer` function in the provided Solidity code includes a requirement that the `amount` being transferred must be greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This means that if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will revert due to this requirement not being met. Therefore, transfers of 0 values will throw an exception and will not be successful.
