NO

The `_transfer` function within the `CHMS` contract includes a requirement that the `amount` must be greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This line will cause the function to revert if a transfer of 0 value is attempted. Therefore, the `transferFrom` function, which calls `_transfer`, will also revert if it is called with an amount of 0.
