YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when the transfer amount is 0. The function checks for sufficient balance and allowance, and if the amount is 0, these checks will pass as long as the sender has a non-negative balance and the caller has a non-negative allowance for at least the amount being transferred (which is 0 in this case).

The `_applyTax` function will also not cause an issue with a 0 value transfer, as it will simply return 0 (0 minus 0% of 0 is still 0).

Therefore, the function should complete successfully without throwing an error when transferring a value of 0, assuming no other conditions are violated (such as the sender or recipient being the zero address).
