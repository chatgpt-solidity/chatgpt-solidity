YES

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The function checks that the recipient is not the zero address, applies taxes if necessary, and checks that the sender has enough balance to cover the final amount after tax. However, if the amount is 0, the final amount after tax will also be 0, and the balance check will pass because subtracting 0 from any balance will not result in a negative number.

Therefore, the function should complete successfully without throwing an error when transferring a value of 0, assuming that the sender has a balance (which can be 0 or more) and the recipient is not the zero address.
