NO

The `_transfer` function contains the following line:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This line explicitly requires that the `amount` being transferred must be greater than zero. Therefore, if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will throw an error due to this requirement not being met.
