NO

The `_transfer` function within the provided Solidity code includes a requirement that the `amount` being transferred must be greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This line will cause the function to revert if a transfer of 0 value is attempted. Therefore, the function and its related parts will throw an error if a transfer of 0 value is attempted.
