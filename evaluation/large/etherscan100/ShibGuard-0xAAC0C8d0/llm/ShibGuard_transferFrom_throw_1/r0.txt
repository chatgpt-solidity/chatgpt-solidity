YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer amount of zero before proceeding with the transfer logic. The function relies on the `_transfer` internal function, which contains the following line:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This line will revert the transaction if the `amount` is zero, as it requires the `amount` to be greater than zero. However, the question asks whether the function and its related parts will not throw if transfers of 0 values are attempted. Since the code will throw an error for a transfer amount of zero due to the `require` statement, the answer to the question is "NO" if we consider the code as it is.

However, if the question is asking whether the function will throw due to issues with arithmetic operations (like division by zero or multiplication overflow) when the transfer amount is zero, then the answer would be "YES" because the SafeMath library handles these cases safely. But the explicit `require` check for the amount being greater than zero will still cause the function to revert for a transfer amount of zero.
