NO

The `_transfer` function in the provided contract code includes a requirement that the `amount` must be greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This means that if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will revert due to this requirement not being met. Therefore, the function and its related parts will throw an error if a transfer of 0 value is attempted.
