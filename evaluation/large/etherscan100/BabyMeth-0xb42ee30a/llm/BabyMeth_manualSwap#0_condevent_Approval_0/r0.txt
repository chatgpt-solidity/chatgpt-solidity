The function `manualSwap()` does not contain an explicit call to a function named `approve` with the parameters `(_spender, _value)`. Instead, it uses a private function `_approve()` to grant the Uniswap router contract an allowance to swap tokens on behalf of the contract. The `_approve()` function is called within the `swapTokensForEth()` function, which is called by `manualSwap()`. However, this does not match the exact signature `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)` as specified in the action.
