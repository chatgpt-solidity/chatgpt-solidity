YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and its related parts does not contain any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The `SafeMath` library is used for arithmetic operations, which ensures that overflows and underflows are handled, but it does not prevent operations with a value of 0.

The `_transfer` function checks for various conditions such as whether trading is open, whether the sender or recipient is a bot, and whether the amount exceeds the maximum transaction limit. However, none of these checks inherently fail when the amount is 0.

The `takeFee` function calculates fees based on the amount being transferred, but if the amount is 0, the fee would also be 0, and the function would return the original amount (which is 0) without any issues.

Therefore, transfers of 0 values should not throw an error based on the provided code.
