The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when the transfer amount is 0. The function adjusts the `allowance` and calls the internal `_transfer` function, which updates the `balanceOf` mapping and emits a `Transfer` event.

Solidity allows arithmetic operations with zero values, and since there are no explicit checks or requirements that the amount be greater than zero, a transfer of 0 value would not cause the function to throw an error. However, it's important to note that the code does not check whether the `from` address has a sufficient balance before performing the subtraction, which could lead to underflow issues if the function were called with an amount greater than the balance of the `from` address. But this is not related to the question of transferring 0 values.
