YES

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and its related parts do not contain any explicit checks that would cause the function to throw if the transfer amount is 0. The function simply subtracts the amount from the sender's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance, then emits a Transfer event. Since Solidity allows arithmetic operations with zero, including subtraction and addition, and since there are no explicit checks against transferring zero values, the function will not throw an exception in this case.
