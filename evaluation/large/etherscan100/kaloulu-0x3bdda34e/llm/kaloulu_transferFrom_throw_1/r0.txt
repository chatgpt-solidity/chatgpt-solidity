YES

The `transferFrom` function and its related parts do not contain any explicit checks that would cause a revert or throw an error when transferring a value of 0. Solidity allows for a transfer of 0 tokens, and the code provided does not have any conditions that would prevent such a transfer. The `_transferFrom` function, which is called by `transferFrom`, will calculate taxes and update balances, but if the amount is 0, it will simply not change any balances or allowances (except for potentially setting the allowance to `type(uint256).max` if it was not already maxed out).

However, it's important to note that while the code does not explicitly prevent 0-value transfers, there could be other factors not visible in the provided code that might affect the execution of a 0-value transfer, such as other contract functions or inherited contract behaviors not shown here.
