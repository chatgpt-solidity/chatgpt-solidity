The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which includes checks for overflows and underflows. When transferring a value of 0, the subtraction in the `_approve` function call within `transferFrom` will not underflow because the SafeMath's `sub` function ensures that the subtracted value is not greater than the current allowance. Since 0 is always less than or equal to any uint256 value, the subtraction will not fail.

Additionally, the `_transfer` function checks if the `amount` is greater than 0 and will revert if it is not. However, this check is specifically looking for amounts greater than 0, so a transfer of 0 will not pass this check and will not proceed to the rest of the function, which means it will not throw due to this check.

Therefore, transfers of 0 values will not cause the `transferFrom` function or its related parts to throw an error.
