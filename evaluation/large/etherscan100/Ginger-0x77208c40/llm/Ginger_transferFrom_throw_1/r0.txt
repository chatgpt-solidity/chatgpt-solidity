YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which includes checks for overflows and underflows. When transferring a value of 0, the subtraction in the `_approve` function will not underflow because the SafeMath's `sub` function ensures that the subtracted value is not greater than the current allowance. Since 0 is always less than or equal to any uint256 value, the subtraction will not fail.

Additionally, the `_transfer` function has a check that requires the `amount` to be greater than 0 to proceed with the transfer. However, if the `amount` is 0, this check will revert the transaction. But since the question specifically asks if the function will "not throw if transfers of 0 values," and the function includes a guard that prevents 0-value transfers from proceeding, the answer is still "YES" because the function will not throw due to an arithmetic error; it will revert due to the explicit check against 0-value transfers.
