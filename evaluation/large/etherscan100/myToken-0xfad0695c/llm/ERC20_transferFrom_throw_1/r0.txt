The `transferFrom` function and its related parts in the provided Solidity code do not contain any explicit checks that would cause a revert or throw an error when the transfer amount is 0. The ERC-20 standard does not require a transfer of 0 value to fail, and the code does not have any conditions that would prevent such a transfer.

The `require` statements in `_transfer` check that the `from` and `to` addresses are not the zero address and that the `from` address has a sufficient balance to cover the transfer amount. However, if the amount is 0, these conditions will still be satisfied: the `from` address will have a balance greater than or equal to 0, and the `to` address can be any non-zero address.

The `_spendAllowance` function also checks that the spender has enough allowance to cover the transfer amount. Again, if the amount is 0, this condition will be satisfied as long as the spender has an allowance greater than or equal to 0, which is always true.

Therefore, transfers of 0 value will not cause the `transferFrom` function to throw or revert based on the provided code.
