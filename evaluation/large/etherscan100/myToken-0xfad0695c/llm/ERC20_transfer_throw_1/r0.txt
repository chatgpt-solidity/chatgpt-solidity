YES

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and its related parts will not throw if transfers of 0 values are made. The function checks that the `from` address has a balance that is greater than or equal to the `amount` to be transferred. If the `amount` is 0, this check will pass because any balance is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, there are no other conditions in the provided code that would cause a revert or throw when transferring an amount of 0. The `require` statements only check for non-zero addresses and sufficient balance, which are not violated by a transfer of 0 value.
