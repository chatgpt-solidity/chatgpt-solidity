YES

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would prevent transfers of 0 values. The `require` statement only checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the amount being transferred. If the amount is 0, this condition will be satisfied (assuming the sender has a non-negative balance, which should always be the case), and the function will not throw an error.

Therefore, the function will execute without reverting when transferring a value of 0.
