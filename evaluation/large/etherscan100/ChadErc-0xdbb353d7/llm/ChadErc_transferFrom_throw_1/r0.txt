YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error if the `amount` being transferred is 0. The function checks if the `_allowances[sender][_msgSender()]` is greater than or equal to the `amount` to be transferred, and if this condition is met, it proceeds to subtract the `amount` from the sender's balance and the allowance, and add it to the recipient's balance.

If the `amount` is 0, the checks and operations will still succeed:

- The allowance check `require(_allowances[sender][_msgSender()] >= amount, "TT: transfer amount exceeds allowance");` will pass because 0 is less than or equal to any non-negative allowance.
- Subtracting 0 from the sender's balance will not change the balance.
- Adding 0 to the recipient's balance will not change the balance.
- Subtracting 0 from the allowance will not change the allowance.

Therefore, the function will complete and return `true` without throwing an error. However, it is important to note that while the function itself does not throw, it is still possible for other factors (such as gas limitations or other contract interactions) to cause a transaction to fail, but these are not related to the transfer of a 0 value within the `transferFrom` function itself.
