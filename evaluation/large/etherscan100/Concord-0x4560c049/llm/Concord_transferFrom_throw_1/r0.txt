The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer amount of zero. Therefore, if the function is called with an `amount` of 0, it will not throw an error due to the transfer amount itself. However, it will still perform the other checks, such as ensuring the `from` address has enough allowance, and the `from` and `to` addresses are not zero.

The `_transfer` function, which is called by `transferFrom`, also does not have a check that would cause it to throw an error for a transfer of 0 tokens. It checks that the `from` address has a sufficient balance and that neither the `from` nor the `to` address is the zero address. If the `amount` is 0, the balance check will pass as long as the `from` address has a non-negative balance.

The `burnFee` function, which is called by `_transfer`, also does not have a check that would cause it to throw an error for a transfer of 0 tokens. It checks that the `sender` has a sufficient balance to cover the `value`, but if the `value` is 0, this check will pass.

Therefore, based on the provided code, transfers of 0 values will not throw an error. However, it is important to note that other conditions in the contract could still cause the function to revert, such as failing allowance checks or other contract-specific conditions.
