The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows. The SafeMath functions `mul`, `div`, `sub`, and `add` are designed to throw (revert the transaction) in case of arithmetic errors.

However, when transferring a value of 0, the following will happen:

1. The `fee` will be calculated as `0.mul(basisPointsRate).div(10000)`, which will result in `0` because any number multiplied by `0` is `0`.
2. Since `fee` is `0`, `sendAmount` will be `_value.sub(fee)`, which is `0.sub(0)`, resulting in `0`.
3. The sender's balance will be reduced by `_value`, which is `0`, so `balances[msg.sender].sub(0)` will not change the sender's balance.
4. The recipient's balance will be increased by `sendAmount`, which is `0`, so `balances[_to].add(0)` will not change the recipient's balance.
5. Since `fee` is `0`, the condition `if (fee > 0)` will not be satisfied, and the owner's balance will not be increased.

Therefore, the function will not throw an error when transferring a value of 0, and the transaction will be successful, emitting a `Transfer` event with a value of `0`.
