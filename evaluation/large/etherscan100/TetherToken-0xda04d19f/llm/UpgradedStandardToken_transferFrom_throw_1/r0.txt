The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not contain any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The `SafeMath` library functions used in `transferFrom` (`sub` and `add`) have checks to prevent underflow and overflow, but these checks will not fail for a transfer value of 0.

Here's why:
- `sub`: When subtracting 0, the `assert(b <= a);` check will pass because 0 is always less than or equal to any uint value.
- `add`: When adding 0, the `assert(c >= a);` check will pass because the sum will be equal to the original value `a`.

Additionally, the `transferFrom` function calculates a fee based on the `_value` being transferred. If `_value` is 0, the fee will also be 0, and the subsequent checks and operations related to the fee will not cause any issues.

Therefore, the function will not throw an error when transferring a value of 0.
