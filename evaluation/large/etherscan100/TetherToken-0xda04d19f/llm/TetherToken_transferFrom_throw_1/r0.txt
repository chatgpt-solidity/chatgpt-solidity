The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not contain any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error if the `_value` parameter (the amount of tokens to be transferred) is 0. The function uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which is designed to prevent overflows and underflows, but it does not prevent transfers of 0 values.

The SafeMath `sub` function will throw an error if the subtraction result would be negative (i.e., if `_value` is greater than the sender's balance or allowance), but it will not throw an error for a subtraction that results in 0. Similarly, the `add` function will not throw an error when adding 0.

Therefore, if the `_value` is 0, the `transferFrom` function will execute the following steps without throwing an error:

1. Calculate the fee, which will be 0 since it's a percentage of the `_value`.
2. Subtract the `_value` (0) from the `_allowance`, which will not change the allowance.
3. Subtract the `_value` (0) from the sender's balance, which will not change the balance.
4. Add the sendAmount (which is `_value` - fee, so also 0) to the recipient's balance, which will not change the balance.
5. If the fee is greater than 0 (which it won't be), it would transfer the fee to the owner, but this step will be skipped.
6. Emit the `Transfer` event with the sendAmount (0).

As long as the function is called with valid addresses and the contract is not paused or the sender is not blacklisted, a transfer of 0 value should not throw an error.
