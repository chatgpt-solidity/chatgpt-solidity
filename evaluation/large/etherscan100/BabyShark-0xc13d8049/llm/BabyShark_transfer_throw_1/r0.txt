YES

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library for subtraction and addition to prevent overflow and underflow issues. If the `numTokens` parameter is 0, the following will happen:

1. The `require` statement `require(numTokens <= balances[msg.sender]);` will pass because 0 is less than or equal to any non-negative balance.

2. The `sub` function from SafeMath will not throw an error because subtracting 0 from the sender's balance does not cause an underflow.

3. The `add` function from SafeMath will not throw an error because adding 0 to the receiver's balance does not cause an overflow.

4. The `Transfer` event will be emitted with the value of 0 for `numTokens`.

Therefore, the function will execute without throwing an error and will return `true`.
