YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error if the `amount` being transferred is 0. The function checks that the `from` address is not the zero address, the `to` address is not the zero address, and that the `from` address has a sufficient balance to cover the `amount` being transferred. However, if the `amount` is 0, these checks will still pass:

- The `from` address is not the zero address.
- The `to` address is not the zero address.
- The `from` address's balance will always be greater than or equal to 0, so the check `fromBalance >= amount` will pass if `amount` is 0.

Therefore, the function will not throw an error and will return `true` even if the `amount` being transferred is 0. The `_transfer` function will adjust balances accordingly, but since the `amount` is 0, the balances will remain unchanged. The `Transfer` event will still be emitted with the `amount` of 0.
