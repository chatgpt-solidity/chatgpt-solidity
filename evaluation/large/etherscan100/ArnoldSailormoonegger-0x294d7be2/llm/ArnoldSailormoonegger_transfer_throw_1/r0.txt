YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and its related parts does not contain any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error if the transfer amount is 0. The `transfer` function calls `_transfer`, which checks that the sender has a sufficient balance and that neither the sender nor the recipient is the zero address. However, there is no check that the amount must be greater than 0.

Therefore, a transfer of 0 value would not inherently cause the function to throw an error, and the function should complete successfully, emitting a `Transfer` event with the amount set to 0.
