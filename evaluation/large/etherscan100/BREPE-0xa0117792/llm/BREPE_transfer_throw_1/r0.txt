YES

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and its related parts will not throw if transfers of 0 values are made. The `SafeMath` library's `sub` and `add` functions are used to safely subtract and add the amount to the sender's and recipient's balances, respectively. These functions include checks to prevent overflow and underflow.

When the amount is 0, the `sub` function will not throw because subtracting 0 from any balance will not cause an underflow (as long as the sender's balance is not negative, which is not possible with unsigned integers in Solidity). Similarly, the `add` function will not throw because adding 0 to any balance will not cause an overflow.

Therefore, the contract is designed to handle transfers of 0 values without reverting.
