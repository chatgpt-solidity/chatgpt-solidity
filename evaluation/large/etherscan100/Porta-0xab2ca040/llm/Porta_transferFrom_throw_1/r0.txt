YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer amount of zero. Therefore, if the function is called with an amount of 0, it will not throw an error due to the transfer amount itself. However, it will still perform the other checks, such as ensuring the `from` and `to` addresses are not zero, and that the caller has enough allowance.

It's important to note that while the `transferFrom` function does not throw an error for a transfer of 0 value, other parts of the contract or the `_transfer` function could potentially revert the transaction for other reasons, such as failing a require statement or triggering a revert in a hook like `_beforeTokenTransfer`. However, based on the code provided and the question asked, the transfer of 0 value itself would not cause the function to throw.
