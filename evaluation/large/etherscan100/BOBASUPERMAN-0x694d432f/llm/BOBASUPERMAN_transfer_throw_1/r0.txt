NO

The `_transfer` function in the provided Solidity code includes a requirement that the `amount` must be greater than 0:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "amount must be greater than 0");
```

This line will cause the function to revert if a transfer of 0 value is attempted. Therefore, the function and its related parts will throw an error if a transfer of 0 value is attempted.
