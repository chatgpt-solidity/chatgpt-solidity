The `_transfer` function in the `ERC20` contract, which is called by the `transferFrom` function, has a requirement that the `amount` must be greater than 0:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "amount must be greater than 0");
```

This means that if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will revert with the message "amount must be greater than 0". Therefore, transfers of 0 values will throw an error and the transaction will fail.
