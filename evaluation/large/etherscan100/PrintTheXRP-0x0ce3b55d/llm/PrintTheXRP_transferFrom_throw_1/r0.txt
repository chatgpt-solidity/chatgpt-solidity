YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not contain any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error or revert the transaction when the transfer amount is 0. The function performs a series of checks and operations, but none of them inherently fail when the amount is 0.

The `_spendAllowance` function will not throw if the amount is 0, as long as the allowance is sufficient (which it is by default for a 0 value transfer).

The `_transfer` function, which is called by `transferFrom`, includes a call to `_basicTransfer` if `inSwapAndLiquify` is true, or it processes the transfer with fees if `inSwapAndLiquify` is false. In both cases, transferring 0 tokens would not cause a revert because subtraction of 0 from the balance will not underflow, and the fee calculation on a 0 transfer would result in a 0 fee.

Therefore, the `transferFrom` function and its related parts will not throw if transfers of 0 values are attempted.
