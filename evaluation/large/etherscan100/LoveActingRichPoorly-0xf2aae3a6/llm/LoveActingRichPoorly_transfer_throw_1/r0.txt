YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and its related parts does not contain any explicit checks that would cause a revert or throw an error when a transfer of 0 value is attempted. The `SafeMath` library functions used in the code (such as `add` and `sub`) will not throw an error for a 0 value as long as the other conditions are met (e.g., the subtraction does not result in a negative number, which would not be the case for a 0 value transfer).

The `_transfer` function checks for `require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");` which would revert the transaction if the amount is 0. However, since the question asks whether the function and its related parts will "not throw if Transfers of 0 values," the answer is NO because the code explicitly requires the amount to be greater than zero, and thus a transfer of 0 would fail this requirement.
