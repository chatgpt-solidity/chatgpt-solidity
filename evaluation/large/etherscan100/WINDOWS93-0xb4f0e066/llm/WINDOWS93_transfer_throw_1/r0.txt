NO

The `_transfer` function in the provided contract code includes the following requirement:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This line explicitly checks that the `amount` being transferred is greater than zero. If a transfer of 0 value is attempted, this requirement will not be met, and the function will throw an error with the message "Transfer amount must be greater than zero". Therefore, the function will not execute successfully with a transfer amount of 0.
