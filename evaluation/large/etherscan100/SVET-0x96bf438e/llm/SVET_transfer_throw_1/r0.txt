NO

The `_transfer` function in the provided Solidity code has a requirement that the `amount` must be greater than 0:

```solidity
require(amount > 0);
```

This means that if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will revert due to this requirement not being met. Therefore, transfers of 0 values will throw an exception and will not be successful.
