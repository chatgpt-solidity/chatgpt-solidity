NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code calls the `_transfer` function, which in turn calls the `preTxCheck` function. The `preTxCheck` function has the following line:

```solidity
require(amount > uint256(0), "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This line requires that the `amount` being transferred must be greater than zero. Therefore, if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the `require` statement will fail, and the function will revert with the message "Transfer amount must be greater than zero". Thus, the function will throw an error for transfers of 0 values.
