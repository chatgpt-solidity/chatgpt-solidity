NO

The `preTxCheck` function within the `_transfer` function has a requirement that explicitly checks if the `amount` is greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > uint256(0), "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

If a transfer of 0 value is attempted, this requirement will fail, and the transaction will revert with the message "Transfer amount must be greater than zero". Therefore, the transfer function and its related parts will throw an error if a transfer of 0 value is attempted.
