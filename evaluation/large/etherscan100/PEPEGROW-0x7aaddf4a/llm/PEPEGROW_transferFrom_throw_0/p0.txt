Given a solidity function transferFrom and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function transferFrom throws unless the _from account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism? Reply in "YES" or "NO"
Note: returning false is not throwing.

Example of authorization mechanism:
Example:"""
contract {
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) {
        transfer(...);
        _allowances[sender][msg.sender] -= amount;
        // omit other codes
    }
}
