NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer amount of 0. However, the function `_transfer` that is called within `transferFrom` contains a line that could potentially throw an error even when the transfer amount is 0:

```solidity
require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
```

If the balance of the `from` address is 0, this `require` statement will throw an error, even if the `amount` to transfer is also 0, because the condition `fromBalance >= amount` would evaluate to `false`.

Additionally, the `_spendAllowance` function called within `transferFrom` also has a `require` statement that could throw an error if the allowance is not sufficient, regardless of the transfer amount being 0:

```solidity
require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: insufficient allowance");
```

If the current allowance is 0, this `require` statement will throw an error when `amount` is 0 because the condition `currentAllowance >= amount` would evaluate to `false`.

Therefore, even if the transfer amount is 0, there are conditions in the code that could cause the function to throw an error.
