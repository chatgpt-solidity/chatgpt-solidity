YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and its related parts does not contain any explicit checks that would cause a revert or throw an error when transferring a value of 0 tokens. The ERC20 standard does not require a transfer of 0 tokens to fail, and the code does not have any additional logic that would prevent such a transfer.

The `_transfer` function checks that the sender and recipient are not the zero address, and that the sender has enough balance to cover the transfer amount. However, if the transfer amount is 0, the sender's balance check (`require(senderBalance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");`) will pass because 0 is less than or equal to any non-negative balance.

Therefore, a transfer of 0 tokens should succeed given the provided code, assuming that the sender is not the zero address, the recipient is not the zero address, and the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook does not introduce any additional restrictions that would prevent a transfer of 0 tokens.
