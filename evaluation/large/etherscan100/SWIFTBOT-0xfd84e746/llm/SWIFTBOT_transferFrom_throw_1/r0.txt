YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The function checks that the sender has enough balance and that the allowance is sufficient, but if the amount is 0, these checks will pass as long as the sender has a non-negative balance and the caller has a non-negative allowance for the sender's tokens.

The `_transfer` function, which is called by `transferFrom`, also does not have any conditions that would cause a revert for a transfer of 0 tokens. It checks that the sender and recipient are not the zero address, and it requires that the sender's balance is at least the amount to be transferred. However, if the amount is 0, the condition `senderBalance >= amount` will be true (assuming senderBalance is non-negative, which it should be for a well-behaved ERC20 token).

Therefore, the `transferFrom` function and its related parts will not throw an error if transfers of 0 values are attempted.
