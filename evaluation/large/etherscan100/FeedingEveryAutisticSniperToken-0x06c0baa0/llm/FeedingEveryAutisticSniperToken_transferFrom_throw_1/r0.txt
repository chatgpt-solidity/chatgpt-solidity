NO

The `preTxCheck` function within the `_transfer` function has a requirement that explicitly checks if the `amount` is greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > uint256(0), "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This means that if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will revert with the message "Transfer amount must be greater than zero". Therefore, transfers of 0 values will throw an error and the transaction will fail.
