NO

The `preTxCheck` function within the `_transfer` function has a requirement that the `amount` must be greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > uint256(0), "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This line will cause the function to revert if a transfer of 0 value is attempted. Therefore, the transfer function and its related parts will throw an error if a transfer of 0 value is attempted.
