YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer amount of zero before proceeding with the transfer logic. The SafeMath library functions used in the code (`sub` and `add`) will not throw an error for a zero value as long as the other conditions are met (e.g., the sender has enough balance, the allowance is sufficient).

The `require` statement within the `_transfer` function checks that the `amount` is greater than zero, which would prevent transfers of zero value. However, this is a logical check rather than a throw caused by a mathematical operation error. If the `amount` is zero, this `require` statement would revert the transaction.

Therefore, if the `transferFrom` function is called with an `amount` of zero, it will revert due to the `require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");` check in the `_transfer` function, not because of a throw caused by the SafeMath operations.
