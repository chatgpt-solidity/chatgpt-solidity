YES

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code checks for the `amount` to be greater than zero with the line `require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");`. This means that if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will revert with the specified error message. Therefore, the function and its related parts will not throw an error if transfers of 0 values are attempted, because such transfers are not allowed in the first place.
