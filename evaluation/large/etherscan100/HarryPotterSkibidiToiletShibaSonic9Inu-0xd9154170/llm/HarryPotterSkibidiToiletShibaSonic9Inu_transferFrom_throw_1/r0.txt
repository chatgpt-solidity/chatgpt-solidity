NO

The `_transfer` function within the `HarryPotterSkibidiToiletShibaSonic9Inu` contract contains the following line:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This line explicitly requires that the `amount` being transferred must be greater than zero. If a transfer of 0 value is attempted, this `require` statement will fail, and the transaction will revert with the message "Transfer amount must be greater than zero". Therefore, transfers of 0 values will indeed throw an error and will not be successful.
