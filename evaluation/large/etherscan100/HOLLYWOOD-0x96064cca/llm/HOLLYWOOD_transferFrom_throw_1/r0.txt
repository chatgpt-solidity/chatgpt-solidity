NO

The `_transfer` function within the `HOLLYWOOD` contract includes a requirement that the `amount` must be greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This means that if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will revert with the message "Transfer amount must be greater than zero". Therefore, transfers of 0 values will not be successful and will cause the function to throw an error.
