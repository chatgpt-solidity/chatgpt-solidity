YES

The `transferFrom` function and its related parts in the provided Solidity code do not contain any explicit checks that would cause a revert or throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The function checks for sufficient balance and allowance, but if the amount is 0, these checks will pass as long as the balance and allowance are not negative, which should not be possible in a correctly functioning ERC20 token contract.

The `_transfer` function contains the following relevant checks:
- `require(from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");`
- `require(to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");`
- `require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");`

None of these checks would fail for a transfer of 0 value as long as `from` and `to` are not the zero address. Additionally, the `calculateFeeAmount` function would return 0 for a 0 value transfer, so no fee would be deducted.

Therefore, the `transferFrom` function should not throw an error when transferring a value of 0, assuming that all other conditions (such as valid addresses and sufficient allowance) are met.
