YES

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and its related parts do not contain any explicit checks that would cause a revert or throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The function checks for the sender's balance to be sufficient and for the sender and recipient addresses not to be the zero address, but it does not check for the amount to be greater than 0.

Therefore, if a transfer of 0 tokens is attempted, the function should execute without reverting, assuming all other conditions (like sufficient balance and valid addresses) are met.
