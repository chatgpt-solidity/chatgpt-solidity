The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which includes checks for overflows and underflows. When transferring a value of 0, the SafeMath functions will not throw an error because:

1. `sub` function: When subtracting 0 from the allowance, it will not underflow since 0 is the smallest possible value for a uint256.
2. `mul` function: Multiplying any value by 0 will result in 0, which is a valid operation and will not cause an overflow.
3. `add` function: Adding 0 to any balance will not change the balance and will not cause an overflow.
4. `div` function: It is not used in the context of transferring 0 value, but even if it were, as long as the divisor is not 0, it will not throw an error.

Additionally, the `_transfer` function checks if the `amount` is greater than 0, but this is a requirement check, not an arithmetic operation that could throw due to a SafeMath operation. If the amount is 0, this check will fail, and the function will revert. However, this is not due to a SafeMath operation but due to the explicit requirement in the contract logic.

Therefore, if the `transferFrom` function is called with an amount of 0, the SafeMath operations will not throw an error. However, the function will revert because of the `require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");` line in the `_transfer` function.
