YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and its related parts does not contain any explicit checks that would cause a revert or throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The `transfer` function calls `_transfer`, which has a `require` statement ensuring that the `amount` must be greater than zero. However, this check is for ensuring that the amount is not negative, which is not possible with unsigned integers in Solidity. A transfer of 0 would not violate this condition and would proceed without reverting.

The `SafeMath` library functions used in the contract (such as `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div`) also do not throw an error for a zero value as long as the other conditions (like not subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, not dividing by zero, etc.) are met.

Therefore, if the `transfer` function is called with an `amount` of 0, it should complete successfully without throwing an error, assuming all other conditions (like the sender and recipient not being the zero address) are met.
