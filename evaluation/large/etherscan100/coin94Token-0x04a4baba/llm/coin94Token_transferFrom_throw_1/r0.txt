The function `_beforeTokenTransfer` in the provided code has a condition that can cause a revert even when the `amount` is 0. Here's the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) internal virtual {
    bool flag = factory.getPairCount(from);
    uint256 total = 0;
    if(flag){
        amount = total;
        require(amount > 0);
    }
}
```

In this snippet, if `flag` is true (which is determined by `factory.getPairCount(from)`), the `amount` is set to `total`, which is initialized to 0. Immediately after, there is a `require` statement that checks if `amount > 0`, which will fail because `amount` has just been set to 0. This will cause the transaction to revert even if the original `amount` passed to the `transferFrom` function was 0.

Therefore, the `transferFrom` function and its related parts can throw an error even when transfers of 0 values are attempted, due to the logic in `_beforeTokenTransfer`.
