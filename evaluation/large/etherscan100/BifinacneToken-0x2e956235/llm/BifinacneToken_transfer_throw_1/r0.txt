YES

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library for subtraction and addition to prevent overflow and underflow. When transferring a value of 0, the SafeMath `sub` function will not throw an error because subtracting 0 from any balance will not cause an underflow, and the `add` function will not throw an error because adding 0 to any balance will not cause an overflow.

Additionally, the `transfer` function checks if the sender is blacklisted and if the contract is deprecated, but these checks do not depend on the transfer value. If the sender is not blacklisted, the contract is not paused, and the contract is not deprecated, the transfer of 0 value will proceed without throwing an error.
