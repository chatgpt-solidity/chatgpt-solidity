YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which includes overflow checks. If the transfer amount `_value` is 0, the following will happen:

1. The allowance check will pass because 0 is less than or equal to any allowance amount.
2. The `sub` function from SafeMath will not throw an error because subtracting 0 from any `_allowance` will not cause an underflow.
3. The `balances[_from]` subtraction will not throw an error for the same reason.
4. The `balances[_to]` addition will not throw an error because adding 0 to any balance will not cause an overflow.

Therefore, the function will not throw an error if the transfer amount `_value` is 0. It will execute the transfer of 0 tokens successfully, updating allowances and balances accordingly, and emitting the Transfer event with a value of 0.
