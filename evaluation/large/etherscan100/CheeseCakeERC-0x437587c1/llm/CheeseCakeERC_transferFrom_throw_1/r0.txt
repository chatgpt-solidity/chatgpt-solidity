YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for the amount being zero before proceeding with the transfer. Therefore, if a transfer of 0 value is initiated, the function will not throw an error due to the amount being zero. It will adjust the allowances (if necessary) and perform the balance updates, which will have no effect since adding and subtracting zero does not change the balances. The function will then emit a `Transfer` event with the amount of zero and return `true`.
