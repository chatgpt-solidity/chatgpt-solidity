YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when the transfer amount is 0. The `SafeMath` library's `sub` function is used to subtract the transfer amount from the sender's balance and the allowance, but as long as the sender has a balance and allowance equal to or greater than the amount being transferred (including 0), the subtraction will not cause an error.

If the amount is 0, the subtraction will result in the same value, and the function will proceed without reverting. The `require` statements in the `_transfer` and `_approve` functions check for valid addresses but do not check the amount being transferred. Therefore, a transfer of 0 value should not cause the function to throw an error.
