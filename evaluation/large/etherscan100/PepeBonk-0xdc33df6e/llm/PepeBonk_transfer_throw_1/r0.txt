YES

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and its related parts do not contain any explicit checks that would cause the function to throw if the transfer amount is 0. The function simply subtracts the amount from the sender's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance, then emits a Transfer event. There are no requirements or assertions that the amount must be greater than 0.

However, it is important to note that this code does not check for underflows or overflows, which could be a problem in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0. If the contract is using Solidity 0.8.0 or later, the arithmetic operations are checked for underflow/overflow by default. If it's using an earlier version, it would be safer to use SafeMath library to prevent such issues. But as per the question's context, the transfer of 0 values will not throw an error.
