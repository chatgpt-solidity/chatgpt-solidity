YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when the transfer amount is 0. The function adjusts the `allowance` and calls the internal `_transfer` function, which updates the `balanceOf` mapping and emits a `Transfer` event.

Solidity allows arithmetic operations with zero, including subtraction and addition, without throwing an error. Therefore, if `amount` is 0, the `allowance` and `balanceOf` mappings will not effectively change, and the function will complete and return `true`.

However, it is important to note that while the provided code does not throw an error for transfers of 0 values, it does not explicitly check for the validity of the `from` and `to` addresses (e.g., ensuring they are not the zero address), nor does it check for underflows/overflows in the balance updates. Solidity 0.8.x and above include built-in overflow/underflow checks, but if this contract is deployed with an earlier version without these checks, it could potentially behave unexpectedly if not properly audited for such issues.
