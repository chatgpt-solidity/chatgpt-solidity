The provided Solidity code for the `safeTransferFrom` function in the `ArtTour` contract does not interact with the `onERC721Received` function or check its return value. Instead, the `safeTransferFrom` function immediately calls the `_transferRevert` private function, which reverts the transaction with a message "Cannot perform transfers on a non-transferable token".

The condition you've mentioned regarding the `onERC721Received` return value is typically checked in a standard ERC721 implementation when tokens are transferred to a smart contract to ensure that the contract can handle ERC721 tokens. However, since the `safeTransferFrom` function in this contract does not perform any actual transfer logic and instead always reverts, the condition about the `onERC721Received` return value is irrelevant in this context.
