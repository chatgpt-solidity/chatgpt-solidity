YES

The `safeTransferFrom` function in the provided code does not depend on the validity of a `_tokenId` because it does not take `_tokenId` into account at all. Instead, it immediately calls the `_transferRevert` function, which unconditionally reverts the transaction with the message "Cannot perform transfers on a non-transferable token". Therefore, regardless of the condition of `_tokenId` being valid or not, the function will throw an error due to the revert statement.
