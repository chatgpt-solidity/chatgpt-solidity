The provided Solidity code for the `safeTransferFrom` function in the `ArtTour` contract does not interact with the `onERC721Received` function or check its return value. Instead, the `safeTransferFrom` function immediately reverts the transaction with a custom error message by calling the `_transferRevert` function, which contains a `revert` statement.

The condition you've mentioned regarding the `onERC721Received` return value is typically checked in a standard ERC721 implementation when tokens are transferred to a smart contract to ensure that the contract can handle ERC721 tokens. However, in this case, since the `safeTransferFrom` function does not actually perform any transfer and instead always reverts, the condition about the `onERC721Received` return value is irrelevant to the behavior of this function.
