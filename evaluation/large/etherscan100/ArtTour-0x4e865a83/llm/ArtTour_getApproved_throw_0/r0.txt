NO

The `getApproved` function in the provided Solidity code is declared as `external pure` and simply returns `address(0)` regardless of the input. The function does not reference any state variables, perform any checks, or throw exceptions based on the input value. Therefore, even if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT, this function will not throw an exception; it will simply return the zero address (`address(0)`).
