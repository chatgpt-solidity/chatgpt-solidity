YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations safely. The SafeMath functions `sub` and `add` are used to decrease the allowance and adjust balances, respectively. These functions include checks to prevent overflows and underflows.

When transferring a value of 0, the SafeMath `sub` function will not throw an error because subtracting 0 from any number does not cause an underflow, and the `require` statement `require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");` will not be triggered since it is not an inequality check (it checks for greater than zero, not greater than or equal to zero).

Therefore, transfers of 0 values will not cause the `transferFrom` function to throw an error, and the function will return `true`.
