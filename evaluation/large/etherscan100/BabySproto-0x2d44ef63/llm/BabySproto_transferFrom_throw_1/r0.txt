YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly throw an error if the `amount` is 0. The function uses the `SafeMath` library for arithmetic operations, which includes checks for overflows and underflows but does not include a check that would cause a revert if the `amount` is 0.

The `_transfer` function, which is called by `transferFrom`, has a `require` statement that checks if the `amount` is greater than 0:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

However, this check will only revert the transaction if the `amount` is strictly less than 0, which is not possible for an unsigned integer (`uint256`). Therefore, if the `amount` is exactly 0, this check will pass, and the function will not throw an error.

The rest of the `_transfer` function handles the logic for fees and balance updates, but none of this logic will throw an error for a transfer of 0 value. The SafeMath functions used (`sub` and `add`) will also not throw an error for a 0 value as long as the other operands are within valid ranges, which they should be in the context of a 0 value transfer.

In conclusion, the `transferFrom` function and its related parts will not throw an error if transfers of 0 values are attempted.
