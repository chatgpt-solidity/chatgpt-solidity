NO

The `_transfer` function contains a requirement that the transfer amount must be greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

This means that if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will revert with the message "Transfer amount must be greater than zero". Therefore, the transfer function and its related parts will throw an error if a transfer of 0 value is attempted.
