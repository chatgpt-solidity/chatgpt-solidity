YES

The `_transfer` function in the provided Solidity code checks if the `amount` is greater than zero with the line `require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");`. This means that if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the function will revert due to this requirement not being met.

However, the question asks whether the function and its related parts will "not throw if Transfers of 0 values." Since the function is designed to revert (or "throw" in Solidity terminology) when a transfer of 0 is attempted, the answer to the question is "NO" because it will indeed throw an error.
