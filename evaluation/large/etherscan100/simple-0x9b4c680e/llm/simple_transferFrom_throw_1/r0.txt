NO

The `_transfer` function in the provided Solidity code includes the following line:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "amount must be greater than 0");
```

This line explicitly requires that the `amount` being transferred must be greater than 0. If a transfer of 0 value is attempted, this `require` statement will cause the transaction to revert with the message "amount must be greater than 0". Therefore, transfers of 0 values will indeed throw an error and the transaction will not be successful.
