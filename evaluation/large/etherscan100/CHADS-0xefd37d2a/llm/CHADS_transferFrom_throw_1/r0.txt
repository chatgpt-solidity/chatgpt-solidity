YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for the `amount` being zero before proceeding with the transfer. Therefore, if a transfer of 0 tokens is requested, the function will not throw an error just because the amount is zero. It will go through the motions of checking allowances and balances, updating them accordingly, and emitting events, but since the amount is zero, no actual token balance will change.

However, it's important to note that other conditions must still be met for the function to not throw an error, such as the `from` address having enough balance (which is trivially true for a transfer of 0 tokens) and the caller having sufficient allowance (also trivially true for a transfer of 0 tokens, unless the allowance is explicitly set to 0). Additionally, the `from` and `to` addresses must not be the zero address. If any of these conditions are not met, the function may still throw an error, but not specifically due to the transfer amount being zero.
