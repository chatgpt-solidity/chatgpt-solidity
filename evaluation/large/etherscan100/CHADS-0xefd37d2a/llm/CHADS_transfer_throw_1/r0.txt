YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and its related parts in the ERC20 contract does not contain any explicit checks that would cause a revert or throw an error when transferring a value of 0 tokens. The `require` statements in the `_transfer` function check for:

1. The `from` address must not be the zero address.
2. The `to` address must not be the zero address.
3. The `from` address must have a balance of at least the `amount` being transferred.

None of these conditions inherently fail when the `amount` is 0. Additionally, the ERC20 standard does not specify that a transfer of 0 tokens should fail. Therefore, a transfer of 0 tokens should succeed, assuming that the `from` and `to` addresses are valid and the `from` address has a sufficient balance (which is trivially true for a transfer of 0 tokens).
