YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and its related parts will not throw if transfers of 0 values are made. The `SafeMath` library's `sub` function is used to subtract the transfer amount from the sender's balance, and it includes a check to ensure that the subtraction does not result in an overflow (which would happen if the sender's balance is less than the amount being transferred). However, if the amount is 0, the subtraction will not underflow, and the sender's balance will remain the same.

The `require` statements in the `_transfer` function check that neither the sender nor the recipient is the zero address, but they do not prevent the transfer of 0 values. Therefore, a transfer of 0 tokens will succeed as long as the sender is not the zero address and the recipient is not the zero address. The `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook is also called, but since it's an empty function in this context, it does not affect the outcome.

In conclusion, the transfer of 0 tokens will complete successfully without reverting, assuming that the sender and recipient addresses are valid (non-zero).
