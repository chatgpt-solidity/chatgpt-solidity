Given a solidity function decimals and the related parts from a smart contract and an rule for its return value.
Whether function decimals returns the number of decimals the token uses? Reply in "YES" or "NO".



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
contract XLEGEND is IERC20, Ownable {
    uint8 private _decimals;    

    /**
     * @dev Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
     * For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
     * be displayed to a user as `5,05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).
     *
     * Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
     * Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless {_setupDecimals} is
     * called.
     *
     * NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
     * no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
     * {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.
