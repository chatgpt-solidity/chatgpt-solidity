YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, which includes checks for overflows and underflows. When transferring a value of 0, the subtraction in the `_approve` function will not underflow because the SafeMath's `sub` function ensures that the subtracted value is not greater than the current allowance.

Additionally, the `_transfer` function checks if the `amount` is greater than 0, but it does not revert if the `amount` is 0. It simply will not execute any of the logic related to fees or token transfers, effectively making a transfer of 0 tokens a no-op.

Therefore, the `transferFrom` function and its related parts will not throw an error if transfers of 0 values are attempted.
