YES

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error if the transfer amount is 0. The function checks if the `amount` is greater than 0, but this is to ensure that the transfer amount is positive and not to prevent a transfer of 0.

The `SafeMath` library functions used in the `_transfer` function (`add` and `sub`) will not throw an error for a transfer of 0 because:

- `add`: Adding 0 to any number will not cause an overflow.
- `sub`: Subtracting 0 from any number will not cause an underflow.

Therefore, if the `transfer` function is called with an `amount` of 0, it should complete without throwing an error, assuming there are no other conditions in the contract that would prevent the transfer (such as paused state, blacklisted addresses, etc., which are not evident from the provided code).
