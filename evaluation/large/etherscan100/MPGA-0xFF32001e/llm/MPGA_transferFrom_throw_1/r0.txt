YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and its related parts does not contain any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error if the transfer amount (`amount`) is 0. The `transferFrom` function calls the `_transfer` function, which has a requirement that the `amount` must be greater than zero:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

However, this requirement only ensures that the `amount` is strictly greater than zero. If the `amount` is exactly 0, this check will not fail, and the function will not throw an error. Instead, the function will proceed with the transfer logic, which in the case of a 0 transfer, will effectively not change any balances but will still emit a Transfer event with a value of 0.

Therefore, the `transferFrom` function and its related parts will not throw an error if the transfer amount is 0.
