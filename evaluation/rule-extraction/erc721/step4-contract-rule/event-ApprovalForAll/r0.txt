Based on the ERC-721 standard provided, the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted under the following condition:

```solidity
/// @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage
///  all of `msg.sender`'s assets
/// @dev Emits the ApprovalForAll event. The contract MUST allow
///  multiple operators per owner.
/// @param _operator Address to add to the set of authorized operators
/// @param _approved True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
```

The condition that triggers the `ApprovalForAll` event is when an owner enables or disables approval for a third party (operator) to manage all of the owner's assets. This is done by calling the `setApprovalForAll` function with the operator's address and a boolean indicating whether the approval is being given or revoked.

Here is the condition in the requested YAML format:

```yaml
conditions:
  - "An owner enables or disables approval for a third party (operator) to manage all of the owner's assets"
```
