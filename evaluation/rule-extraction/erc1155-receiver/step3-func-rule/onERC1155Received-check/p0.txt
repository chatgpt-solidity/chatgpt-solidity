Given an ERC. which contains a list of functions, events, and rules. Each function has its own rules, usually above their Solidity declaration.  
Rules indicating throw or check usually have the linguistic patterns:"""
<subject> MUST throw if <condition>
MUST check <object> <condition>
<condition> MUST treated as
<subject> checks [condition]
Caller must be approved to <action>
[necessity] revert [condition]
Caller <necessity> be the <target>
"""
Other patterns that indicate similar meaning also count.
List the conditions that need to be thrown or checked in the given ERC for function "function onERC1155Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) returns(bytes4)" for ERC1155TokenReceiver in a YAML array with the following format:

<if>: <string, condition to throw or check>
throw: <boolean, whether it need to throw or should not be thrown>

If no such rule, simply left empty.
