The `move` function in the `DSToken` contract calls the `transferFrom` function, which returns a boolean value indicating success. However, the `move` function does not handle or return this boolean value; it simply calls `transferFrom` without using its return value. This means that the `move` function does not comply with the rule that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if the callee returns a boolean success value.
