NO

The function `setOwner` and its related parts do not violate the given rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they call any callee that returns a boolean (`bool success`). However, in the provided code, there are no external calls being made that return a boolean value which would require handling or returning.

The `setOwner` function simply sets the `owner` state variable to the provided `owner_` address and emits a `LogSetOwner` event. There is no call to another contract or function that returns a boolean value that needs to be handled according to the rule.

The `isAuthorized` function does return a boolean, but it is used internally within the `auth` modifier to check if the message sender is authorized to call the function. It does not involve an external call that returns a boolean value that needs to be handled or returned by the caller. The `auth` modifier uses `require` to ensure that the function can only be executed if the sender is authorized, which is in line with standard authorization patterns in Solidity.
