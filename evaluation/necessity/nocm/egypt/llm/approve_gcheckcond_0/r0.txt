NO

The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code does not call any other functions that return a boolean value. It simply sets a value in the `allowance` mapping and emits an event. The function itself returns a boolean value (`true`), indicating success, but it does not handle or directly return the result of any other function calls, as there are none within the `approve` function. Therefore, it does not violate the given rule.
