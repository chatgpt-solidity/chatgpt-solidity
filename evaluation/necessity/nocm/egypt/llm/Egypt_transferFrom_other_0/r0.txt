NO

The provided Solidity function `transferFrom` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC-20 rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the given code that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated the same as any other transfer. The function checks for allowances, performs the transfer by calling `_transfer`, and emits a Transfer event, regardless of the value being transferred. 

However, it is important to note that while the code does not explicitly violate the rule, it also does not contain any explicit checks or comments to ensure that 0-value transfers are allowed. In practice, the code should work for 0-value transfers as long as the allowance is sufficient and the `_from` address is not the zero address.
