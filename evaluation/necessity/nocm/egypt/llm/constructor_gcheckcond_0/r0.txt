NO

The provided Solidity function constructor does not make any external calls to other contracts or functions that return a boolean success value. The constructor is simply initializing state variables and setting the initial balance for a specific address within the contract itself. There are no calls to external functions or contracts that would require handling or directly returning a result as specified by the rule.
