Given a solidity function giveBlockReward and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function giveBlockReward and the related parts violate the rule? Replay in "YES" or "NO".
Notes: Before Solidity version 0.5, events are emitting without "emit" keyword.

Example of "initial token distribution" are provided below. 
Example:"""
construct <Contract Name> {
    constructor() {
        // tokens are transfer during the initial token distribution:
        balances[msg.sender] = total;
    }
}
"""



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
pragma solidity 0.4.22;
contract Egypt {

    // This creates an array with all balances
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    function giveBlockReward() public {
        balanceOf[block.coinbase] += 1;
    }
}
"""

Rule:"""
