The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code does not directly handle or return the result of the `send` and `transfer` calls that return a boolean success value. Instead, it uses `require` to assert that the `send` call on the `recipient` must succeed, but it does not handle the return value of the `transfer` calls on the `Token(curAddress)` contract.

Here's the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function assignEther(address payable recipient, uint256 _amount) internal {
    require(recipient.send(_amount));
}

// ...

Token(curAddress).transfer(msg.sender, sentAmount);
if (returnAmount != 0) {
    Token(curAddress).transfer(_to, returnAmount);
}
```

The `require` statement in `assignEther` will revert the transaction if the `send` fails, but it does not return the result to the caller. Similarly, the `transfer` calls on the `Token` contract do not handle the return value; they assume success without checking the boolean result.

According to the rule provided, the contract should handle or directly return the result of these calls, which it does not do. Therefore, the code violates the rule.
