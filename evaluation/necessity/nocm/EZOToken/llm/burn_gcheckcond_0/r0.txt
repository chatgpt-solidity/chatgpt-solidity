NO

The `burn` function in the `EZOToken` contract does not call any external callee that returns a boolean value (`bool success`). The `burn` function itself is designed to return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation, but it does not make any calls to other functions or contracts that return a success value that needs to be handled or directly returned.

The `safeSub` function from the `SafeMath` contract is called twice, but it does not return a boolean; it returns a `uint256` value, and any error in subtraction would cause an assertion failure rather than returning a boolean. Therefore, the rule is not violated because there are no callee functions returning a boolean that the `burn` function needs to handle or return.
