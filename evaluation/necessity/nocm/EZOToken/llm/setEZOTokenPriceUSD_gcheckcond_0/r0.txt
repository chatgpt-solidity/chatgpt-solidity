NO

The function `setEZOTokenPriceUSD` does not call any callee that returns a boolean value (`bool success`). It simply sets the value of `ezoTokenPriceUSD` after checking that the new price is not zero. The rule provided is concerned with handling return values from calls that return a success flag, which is not applicable in this case.
