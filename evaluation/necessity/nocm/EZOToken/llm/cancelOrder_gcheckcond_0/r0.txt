The `cancelOrder` function does not directly handle or return the result of the `send` call within the `assignEther` function. The `assignEther` function uses `require(recipient.send(_amount))`, which will revert the transaction if the `send` fails, but it does not return a boolean value to the caller (`cancelOrder`) to indicate success or failure. The `cancelOrder` function itself does not return any value or handle the result of the `send` call; it only relies on the `require` statement to ensure that the `send` does not fail.
