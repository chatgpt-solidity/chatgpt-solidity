NO

The provided Solidity function constructor and its related parts do not violate the given rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they call any callee that returns a boolean success value.

In the provided code, the constructor for the `EZOToken` contract does not make any external calls that return a boolean success value. It simply initializes the state variables `totalSupply`, `balances`, and `isEZOToken`. There are no calls to any functions or contracts that return a boolean value that would need to be handled or returned according to the rule.

Therefore, the constructor and related parts do not violate the provided rule.
