NO

The provided Solidity function `unHalt` and the related parts of the smart contract do not involve transferring tokens or handling any kind of token balance updates. The function `unHalt` is simply used to change the state of the `halted` boolean variable from `true` to `false`. Since there are no token transfers occurring within this function, the rule to "Emit Transfer if tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers" does not apply to this function or the related parts of the contract provided.
