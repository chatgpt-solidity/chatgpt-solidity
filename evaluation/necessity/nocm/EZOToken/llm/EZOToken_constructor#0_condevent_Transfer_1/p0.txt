Given a solidity function constructor and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function constructor and the related parts violate the rule? Replay in "YES" or "NO".
Notes: Before Solidity version 0.5, events are emitting without "emit" keyword.



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
