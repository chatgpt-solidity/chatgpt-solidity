NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any direct calls to external contracts or functions that return a boolean success value that needs to be checked or handled by the caller. The `_transfer` function and other related internal functions such as `_transferStandard`, `_transferBothExcluded`, `_transferFromExcluded`, and `_transferToExcluded` do not make external calls that return a success boolean. They are all internal logic that handles token transfers within the contract itself, using the SafeMath library to prevent arithmetic overflows.

The rule provided is about handling return values from external calls, which is not applicable to the internal function calls shown in the provided code. Therefore, the code does not violate the given rule.
