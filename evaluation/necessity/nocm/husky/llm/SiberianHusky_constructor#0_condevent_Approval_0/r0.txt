NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any implementation of the `approve` function or any calls to it. The rule you've provided is specific to the `approve` function, which is part of the ERC-20 token standard. The rule states that the `Approval` event should be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully called.

The code you've shared includes a constructor for the `SiberianHusky` contract, which initializes the contract's state and emits a `Transfer` event to indicate that the initial supply of tokens has been assigned to the creator of the contract. It also includes a constructor for the `Ownable` contract, which sets the initial owner and emits an `OwnershipTransferred` event.

Since the `approve` function is not part of the provided code, and there are no calls to `approve`, there is no violation of the rule based on the given code snippet. The rule is not applicable to the constructors or the events that are being emitted in the provided constructors (`Transfer` and `OwnershipTransferred`).
