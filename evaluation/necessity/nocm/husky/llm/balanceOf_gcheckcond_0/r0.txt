The `balanceOf` function and its related parts do not violate the provided rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if any callee returns a `(bool success)` value. However, the `balanceOf` function and the functions it calls (`tokenFromReflection` and `_getCurrentSupply`) do not return a `bool success` value. Instead, they return `uint256` values, which represent token balances and rates. The `SafeMath` library functions used in these calls (`div` and `sub`) also do not return a `bool success` but rather return `uint256` results or revert with an error message if a condition is not met (such as division by zero or subtraction overflow). Therefore, the rule concerning handling a `bool success` return value does not apply to this code.
