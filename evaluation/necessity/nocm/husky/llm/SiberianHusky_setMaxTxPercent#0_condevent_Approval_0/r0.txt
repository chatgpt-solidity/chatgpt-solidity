NO

The provided function `setMaxTxPercent` and the related parts of the smart contract do not violate the specified rule. The rule states that the `Approval` event should be emitted if there is any successful call to the `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)` function. However, the `setMaxTxPercent` function provided in the code snippet is not related to the `approve` function, and it does not involve emitting an `Approval` event.

The `setMaxTxPercent` function is designed to set the maximum transaction amount as a percentage of the total supply, and it is only callable by the owner of the contract. It does not interact with the approval mechanism of the ERC20 token standard, which would require emitting the `Approval` event.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the specified rule, the function does not violate the rule.
