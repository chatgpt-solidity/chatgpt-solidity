NO

The provided function `setMaxTxPercent` and the related parts of the smart contract do not violate the specified rule. The rule states that a Transfer event should be emitted if tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers. However, the `setMaxTxPercent` function does not perform any token transfers. It only sets the `_maxTxAmount` variable, which is likely used to limit the amount of tokens that can be transferred in a single transaction.

The function modifies a state variable to enforce a transaction limit based on a percentage of the total token supply (`_tTotal`). It does not involve the transfer of tokens between addresses, and therefore, there is no need to emit a Transfer event within this function.

The rule would apply to functions that actually transfer tokens, such as `transfer`, `transferFrom`, or any other function that results in a change of token balances between accounts. In those cases, a Transfer event must be emitted to reflect the change in token balances.
