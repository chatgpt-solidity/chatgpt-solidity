The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and related parts of the contract does not appear to violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The code does not contain any explicit checks that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer. The `transfer` function calls `_transfer`, which performs the necessary checks and state updates, and there is no condition that would reject a transfer of 0 value.

However, it's important to note that the code provided is incomplete and does not show the entire contract or the implementation of the `IERC20` interface. To fully confirm compliance with the ERC rule, the entire contract and all related functions would need to be reviewed.
