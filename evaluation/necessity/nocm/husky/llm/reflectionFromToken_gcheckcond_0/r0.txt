The function `reflectionFromToken` does not call any callee that returns a tuple including a `bool success`. It only performs internal calculations and returns a `uint256` value. The related functions `_getValues`, `_getTValues`, `_getRate`, `_getRValues`, and `_getCurrentSupply` also do not return a `bool success` as part of their return values. They either return `uint256` or tuples of `uint256`.

The SafeMath library functions used (`div`, `sub`, `mul`) do not return a `bool success` either; they return `uint256` and revert on failure with a require statement, which is the expected behavior according to the rule provided.
