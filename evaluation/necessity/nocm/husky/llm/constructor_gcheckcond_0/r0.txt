NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any external calls or function calls that return a boolean value (`bool success`) which would require handling or directly returning the result. The constructors in the `SiberianHusky` and `Ownable` contracts do not make any calls that return a boolean. They are simply initializing state variables and emitting events. Therefore, the rule is not violated.
