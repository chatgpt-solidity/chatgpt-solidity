NO

The function `tokenFromReflection` does not call any callee that returns a `bool success`. It only performs arithmetic operations using the `SafeMath` library, which either returns a `uint256` or reverts the transaction with an error message if an arithmetic operation fails. There is no `bool success` return value to handle or directly return in this function.
