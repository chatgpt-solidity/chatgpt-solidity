NO

The `increaseAllowance` function does not directly handle or return the result of a call to a callee that returns a boolean (`bool success`). Instead, it calls the `_approve` private function, which does not return any value, and then unconditionally returns `true`. The rule is not violated because there is no boolean result from a callee to handle or return.
