NO

The provided Solidity function `BNB` (which is actually a constructor for the `BNB` contract) does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value (`bool success`). The constructor simply initializes state variables and assigns the initial token supply to the message sender (`msg.sender`). There are no external calls made, and therefore, there is no rule violation regarding handling or directly returning the result of calls that return a boolean success value.
