NO

The `unfreeze` function in the provided Solidity code does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value indicating success. The `unfreeze` function itself is designed to return a boolean value, but it does not call any other functions that return such a value that would require handling according to the rule provided.

The `unfreeze` function uses two internal functions from the `SafeMath` contract, `safeSub` and `safeAdd`, which do not return a boolean value; they return a `uint256` value. Additionally, these functions use assertions to ensure that the arithmetic operations are safe, and if an assertion fails, they throw an exception rather than returning a boolean value.

Therefore, the `unfreeze` function does not violate the provided rule.
