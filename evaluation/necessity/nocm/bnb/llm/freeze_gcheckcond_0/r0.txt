NO

The function `freeze` in the provided code does not call any other functions that return a boolean value (`bool success`). The only external calls it makes are to `SafeMath.safeSub` and `SafeMath.safeAdd`, which do not return a boolean but rather return a `uint256`. The `assert` function in `SafeMath` does not return any value; it either passes silently or throws an error if the assertion fails.

Therefore, since the `freeze` function does not call any functions that return a boolean value, it does not violate the provided rule.
