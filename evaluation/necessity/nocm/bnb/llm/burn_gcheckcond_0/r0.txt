NO

The `burn` function in the provided contract does not call any external callee that returns a boolean value (`bool success`). The only calls it makes are to the internal functions `safeSub` from the inherited `SafeMath` contract, which do not return a boolean but rather a `uint256` value representing the result of a subtraction operation. The `burn` function itself returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation, which is in line with the rule provided.
