NO

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value indicating success. The `transfer` function only interacts with the contract's own state and uses internal functions from the `SafeMath` contract to perform safe arithmetic operations. These `SafeMath` functions (`safeSub` and `safeAdd`) do not return a boolean success value; instead, they return the result of the arithmetic operation or throw an error if the operation fails.

Therefore, the `transfer` function does not violate the given rule, as there are no callee functions returning a boolean success value that the caller needs to handle or return.
