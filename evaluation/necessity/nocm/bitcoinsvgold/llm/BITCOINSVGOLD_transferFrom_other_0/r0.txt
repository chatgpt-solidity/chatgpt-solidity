NO

The function `transferFrom` in the provided Solidity code does not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The condition `_value > 0` is not preventing the transfer of 0 values; it is simply one of the checks to ensure that the `_value` being transferred is not negative, which is not possible with unsigned integers in Solidity anyway.

The function checks if the balance of the `_from` address is sufficient, if the allowance for `msg.sender` to spend from `_from`'s balance is sufficient, and if the `_value` is greater than 0. If all conditions are met, the transfer proceeds, and the `Transfer` event is emitted. If the `_value` is 0, the transfer can still proceed, and the balances will not change, effectively treating it as a normal transfer.

Therefore, the function complies with the ERC rule regarding transfers of 0 values.
