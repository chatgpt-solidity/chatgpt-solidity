NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not violate the given rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they call any callee that returns a boolean success value.

In the provided `transferFrom` function, the boolean success value is being directly returned after the conditions are checked and the state changes are made (if the conditions are met). There are no external calls to other contracts or functions that return a boolean value which are not being handled or returned. The function itself is the callee and it returns the success value as per the rule's requirement.
