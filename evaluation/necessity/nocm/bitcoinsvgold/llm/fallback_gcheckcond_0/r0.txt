NO

The provided Solidity function (fallback function) does not directly call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value indicating success or failure. The fallback function is simply handling incoming Ether transactions, updating balances within the contract, and transferring Ether to the `fundsWallet`. The `transfer` method used on the `fundsWallet` is a built-in method of the address type in Solidity, which automatically throws on failure and does not return a boolean success value. Therefore, it does not violate the given rule.
