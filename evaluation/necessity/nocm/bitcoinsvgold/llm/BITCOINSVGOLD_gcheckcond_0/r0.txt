NO

The provided Solidity code for the `BITCOINSVGOLD` contract does not contain any external calls or internal function calls that return a boolean value (`bool success`). The code snippet only includes the constructor function for the `BITCOINSVGOLD` contract, which initializes state variables and does not make any calls to other contracts or functions that return a boolean success value.

Therefore, since there are no calls that return a boolean value, there is no opportunity for the rule to be violated in the given code snippet. The rule pertains to handling the result of calls that return a boolean, but such calls are not present in the provided code.
