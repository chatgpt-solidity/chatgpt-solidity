NO

The function `transfer` in the provided code does not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The condition `_value > 0` is not present in the `if` statement, which means that the function allows the transfer of 0 values. The code correctly checks if the sender has enough balance to cover the transfer amount and does not impose any restrictions on the value being transferred, including 0. Therefore, the function complies with the ERC rule regarding 0 value transfers.
