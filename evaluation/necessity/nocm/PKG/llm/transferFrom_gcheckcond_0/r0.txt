NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not violate the given rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they call any callee that returns a boolean success value.

In the provided `transferFrom` function, the `_transfer` internal function is called, which does not return any value (hence, it does not return a boolean success value). Therefore, there is no boolean success value to handle or return directly from the `_transfer` call.

The `transferFrom` function itself returns a boolean success value (`true`) after successfully executing the `_transfer` function, which is in compliance with the rule. The rule does not apply to the internal `_transfer` function since it does not return a value.
