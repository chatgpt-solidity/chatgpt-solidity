NO

The provided Solidity function `_transfer` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC rule stating that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `_transfer` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer. The function checks for the sender's balance and the validity of the recipient's address, but it does not reject a transfer based on the value being 0.

However, it's worth noting that the code does not include an event declaration for `Transfer`, which is typically required by the ERC-20 standard to log transfer events. While this omission doesn't directly relate to the rule in question, it is a deviation from the standard that should be addressed. The correct declaration and emission of the `Transfer` event would look something like this:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```

And the event should be emitted as follows:

```solidity
emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
```

This is assuming that the contract is intended to be ERC-20 compliant. If the contract is meant to follow a different ERC standard, the requirements might vary.
