Given a solidity function withdraw and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function withdraw and the related parts violate the rule? Replay in "YES" or "NO".
Notes: Before Solidity version 0.5, events are emitting without "emit" keyword.

Example of "initial token distribution" are provided below. 
Example:"""
construct <Contract Name> {
    constructor() {
        // tokens are transfer during the initial token distribution:
        balances[msg.sender] = total;
    }
}
"""



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
pragma solidity 0.4.23;
contract ICOToken is BaseToken {
    address public icoHolder;

    function withdraw() {
        uint256 balance = this.balance;
        icoHolder.transfer(balance);
        Withdraw(msg.sender, icoHolder, balance);
    }
}
"""

Rule:"""
Emit Transfer if tokens are transferred during the initial token distribution or crowdsale.
