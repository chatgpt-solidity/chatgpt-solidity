NO

The provided code snippet does not include any implementation of the `approve` function, nor does it show any event declaration for `Approval`. The rule states that the `Approval` event should be emitted if there is a successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`. Since the `approve` function and the `Approval` event are not part of the provided code, we cannot determine whether the rule is violated based on the given information.
