NO

The provided Solidity function `CustomToken` is a constructor for a contract that inherits from `BaseToken`, `BurnToken`, and `ICOToken`. The constructor initializes the state variables of the contract but does not perform any token transfer or burning operations. Therefore, there is no need to emit a `Transfer` event within this constructor function.

The rule "Emit Transfer if tokens are burning or deallocating" applies to functions that actually burn or deallocate tokens, which would typically be methods that reduce the `totalSupply` or `balanceOf` an address. Since the constructor is only setting initial values and not performing any actions that would require a `Transfer` event, it does not violate the rule.
