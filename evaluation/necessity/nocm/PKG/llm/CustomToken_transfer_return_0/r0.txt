NO

The given `transfer` function in the Solidity code does not explicitly return a value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. However, the provided code does not have a return statement, and thus it does not comply with the ERC rule that requires a return value indicating the success of the transfer.
