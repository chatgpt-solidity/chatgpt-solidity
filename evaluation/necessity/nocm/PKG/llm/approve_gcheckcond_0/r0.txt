NO

The function `approve` in the provided Solidity code does not call any other functions that return a boolean value. It simply sets a value in the `allowance` mapping and emits an event (`Approval`). The function itself returns a boolean value (`true`), indicating success, but it does not handle or directly return the result of any other calls, because there are no other calls being made within the function. Therefore, it does not violate the given rule.
