NO

The provided Solidity function `transferFrom` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the given code that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer. The function does not include a check for `_value` being greater than 0, so it should allow transfers of 0 value to proceed.

However, it's important to note that the code provided does not include the entire contract, and there could be other parts of the contract that enforce additional constraints on transfers. But based on the given snippet, the rule is not violated.
