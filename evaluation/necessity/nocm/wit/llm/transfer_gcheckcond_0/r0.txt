The `transfer` function in the `WiT` contract does not directly handle or return the result of the `transfer` function call from the `AbstractToken` contract. Instead, it has a conditional statement that checks if the `frozen` variable is `true`. If `frozen` is `true`, it returns `false` without calling the `transfer` function from the `AbstractToken` contract. If `frozen` is `false`, it proceeds to call the `AbstractToken.transfer` function but does not handle the result; it simply returns whatever the `AbstractToken.transfer` function returns.

The `transfer` function in the `AbstractToken` contract does follow the rule by directly returning the result of the `safeSub` and `safeAdd` function calls from the `SafeMath` contract, which return a `bool` indicating success. However, the rule is not fully adhered to in the `WiT` contract's `transfer` function, as it should handle or return the result of the `AbstractToken.transfer` call directly, without the conditional check for `frozen`.
