NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any implementation of the `approve` function, nor does it show the `Approval` event being emitted. The rule states that the `Approval` event should be emitted if there is a successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`. Since the `approve` function and the event emission are not part of the provided code, we cannot determine whether the rule is violated based on the given information. 

To fully audit the contract for compliance with the rule, the implementation of the `approve` function and the associated `Approval` event would need to be reviewed. If the `approve` function exists elsewhere in the contract and does not emit the `Approval` event upon a successful call, then it would violate the rule. However, this cannot be concluded from the provided code snippet.
