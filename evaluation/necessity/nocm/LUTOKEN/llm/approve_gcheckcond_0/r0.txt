NO

The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code does not call any other functions that return a boolean value (`bool success`). It simply sets the allowance in the `allowed` mapping and emits an `Approval` event, then returns `true`. There are no external calls or calls to functions that return a success value that need to be handled or directly returned. Therefore, the function does not violate the given rule.
