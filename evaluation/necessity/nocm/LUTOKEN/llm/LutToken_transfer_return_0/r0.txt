The `transfer` function in the `LutToken` contract is designed to return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful. However, the function as written does not explicitly return a value. Instead, it calls `super.transfer(_to, _value);` which is expected to return a boolean value, but the return value is not captured or returned by the `transfer` function in `LutToken`.

The `transfer` function in `BasicToken` (which `LutToken` would inherit from if the inheritance hierarchy were fully provided) does return a boolean value as per the ERC20 standard. However, since the `transfer` function in `LutToken` does not explicitly return the value from `super.transfer(_to, _value);`, it violates the rule that it must return whether the transfer is successful.

Therefore, the answer is YES, the return value of the function `transfer` violates the given rule. The `transfer` function in `LutToken` should be modified to explicitly return the boolean result from the `super.transfer(_to, _value);` call, like so:

```solidity
function transfer(
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) public whenNotPaused saleOrUnfrozen returns (bool) {
    return super.transfer(_to, _value);
}
```
