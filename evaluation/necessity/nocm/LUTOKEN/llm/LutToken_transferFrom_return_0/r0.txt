NO

The `transferFrom` function in the `LutToken` contract does not explicitly return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer. Instead, it calls `super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value);` without returning the result of this call.

According to the ERC20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful. The `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract, which is likely the parent contract based on the `super` call, does return a boolean value. However, the `transferFrom` function in the `LutToken` contract should also return this value to comply with the ERC rule.

To comply with the ERC rule, the `transferFrom` function in the `LutToken` contract should be modified to return the result of the `super.transferFrom` call, like so:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) public whenNotPaused saleOrUnfrozen returns (bool) {
    return super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value);
}
```
