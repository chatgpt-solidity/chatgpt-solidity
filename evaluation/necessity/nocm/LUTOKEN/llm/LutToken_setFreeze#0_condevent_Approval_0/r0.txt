NO

The provided function `setFreeze` and the related parts of the smart contract do not show any interaction with the `approve` function or the `Approval` event. The rule specifies that the `Approval` event should be emitted if there is a successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`. Since the `setFreeze` function does not involve calling `approve` or emitting `Approval`, it does not violate the specified rule.
