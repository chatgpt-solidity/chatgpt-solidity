YES

The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function in the `LutToken` contract does not explicitly emit a `Transfer` event when tokens are transferred. However, it calls `super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value);` which is expected to be the `transferFrom` function from the `StandardToken` contract. In the `StandardToken` contract, the `transferFrom` function does emit a `Transfer` event.

The rule states that a `Transfer` event should be emitted if tokens are burning or deallocating. The provided code does not show any direct burning or deallocating of tokens within the `transferFrom` function itself. Token burning typically involves reducing the total supply and sending tokens to a burn address (often the zero address), which is not shown in the provided `transferFrom` function.

However, without the full context of the contract and how the `burn` function is implemented (which is not provided), it is not possible to definitively say whether the contract always emits a `Transfer` event when tokens are burned. If the `burn` function or any other function that deallocates tokens does not emit a `Transfer` event, then the contract would violate the rule.

Given the information provided, the `transferFrom` function in the `LutToken` contract does not violate the rule within its own scope, as it relies on the `StandardToken` implementation to emit the `Transfer` event. But we cannot be certain about the entire contract's compliance with the rule without seeing the implementation of the `burn` function or other functions that may deallocate tokens.
