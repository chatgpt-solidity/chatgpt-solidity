The function `decreaseApproval` does not violate the rule. The function itself returns a boolean value (`true`) to indicate success, and it does not make any external calls to other contracts that return a boolean value which would require handling or directly returning as per the rule specified. The only external call it makes is to the `sub` function from the `SafeMath` library, which does not return a boolean but rather the result of the subtraction or throws an error if the subtraction would result in an overflow. The `decreaseApproval` function properly emits an `Approval` event and returns `true` at the end, which is consistent with the ERC20 standard for this function.
