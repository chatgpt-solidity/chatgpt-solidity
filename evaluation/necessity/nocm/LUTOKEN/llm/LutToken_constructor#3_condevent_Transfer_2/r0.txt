The `LutToken` constructor is allocating the entire initial supply of tokens to the `msg.sender` address, but it does not emit a `Transfer` event to reflect this action. According to the ERC20 standard, a `Transfer` event should be emitted whenever tokens are transferred, including when they are created (minted) or allocated for the first time.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
constructor(
    string _name,
    string _symbol,
    uint8 _decimals,
    uint256 _totalSupply
)
    public
    UpgradeableToken(msg.sender)
    DetailedERC20(_name, _symbol, _decimals)
{
    totalSupply_ = _totalSupply;
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply_;
    // Missing Transfer event emission
}
```

To comply with the rule, the constructor should include an `emit Transfer` statement like this:

```solidity
emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, totalSupply_);
```

This line should be added after the `balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply_;` line to properly log the transfer from the zero address (which represents token creation) to the `msg.sender` address.
