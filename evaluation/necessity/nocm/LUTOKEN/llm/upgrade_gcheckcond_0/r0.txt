NO

The `upgrade` function in the provided Solidity code does not directly call any functions that return a boolean value indicating success. The `upgrade` function interacts with the `balances` mapping and the `totalSupply_` and `totalUpgraded` state variables using SafeMath library functions `sub` and `add`, which do not return a boolean success value but instead use assertions to ensure that no overflow or underflow occurs.

The `upgradeAgent.upgradeFrom(msg.sender, value);` call is to an external contract and does not return a value that is checked or handled in the `upgrade` function. The rule provided is specifically about handling boolean success values, and since no such values are being returned from the calls within the `upgrade` function, the rule is not violated.
