YES

The provided Solidity code does not show any explicit event emission for the initial token distribution within the constructor of the contract. The constructor is setting the balance of the `msg.sender` to the total supply, but it does not emit a `Transfer` event to reflect this initial distribution.

According to the rule provided, a `Transfer` event should be emitted if tokens are transferred during the initial token distribution or crowdsale. Since the constructor is part of the initial token distribution and it does not emit a `Transfer` event, the code violates the rule.
