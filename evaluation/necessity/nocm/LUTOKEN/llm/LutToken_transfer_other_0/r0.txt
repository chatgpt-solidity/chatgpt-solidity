NO

The provided `transfer` function in the `BasicToken` contract does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. According to the ERC rule that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers," the function should allow transfers of 0 values to proceed without any special conditions.

The `transfer` function in the `LutToken` contract, which extends `BasicToken`, also does not have any explicit checks that would prevent a transfer of 0 value. It includes additional modifiers `whenNotPaused` and `saleOrUnfrozen` to check for paused state and token frozen state, but these do not relate to the transfer value itself.

Since the `transfer` function does not reject or treat 0 value transfers differently, it complies with the ERC rule stated.
