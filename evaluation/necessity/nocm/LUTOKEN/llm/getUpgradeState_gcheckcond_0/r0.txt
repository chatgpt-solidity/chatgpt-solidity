The function `getUpgradeState` does not call any callee that returns a `bool success`. The function `canUpgrade` is called, but it returns a `bool` that is not labeled as `success`, and it is used for conditional logic within the function rather than being handled or directly returned as a result of the call. The function `getUpgradeState` returns an `UpgradeState` enum value based on the conditions checked within the function.
