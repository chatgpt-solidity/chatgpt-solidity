NO

The provided Solidity function constructors and related parts do not violate the given rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they call any callee that returns a boolean success value. However, the constructors provided in the code do not make any external calls that return a boolean success value. Constructors are used to initialize contract state, and in the given code, they are only setting internal variables and do not involve any external calls that would return a success value to handle or return.
