Given a solidity function renounceOwnership and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function renounceOwnership and the related parts violate the rule? Replay in "YES" or "NO".
Notes: Before Solidity version 0.5, events are emitting without "emit" keyword.

Example of "initial token distribution" are provided below. 
Example:"""
construct <Contract Name> {
    constructor() {
        // tokens are transfer during the initial token distribution:
        balances[msg.sender] = total;
    }
}
"""



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
pragma solidity 0.4.22;
contract Ownable {
    address public owner;

    /**
     * @dev Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
     */
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Allows the current owner to relinquish control of the contract.
     */
    function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {
        emit OwnershipRenounced(owner);
        owner = address(0);
    }
