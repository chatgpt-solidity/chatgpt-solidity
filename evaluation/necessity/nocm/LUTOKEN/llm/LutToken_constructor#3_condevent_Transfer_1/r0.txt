NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any part of the code where a Transfer event is emitted. The rule states that a Transfer event should be emitted if tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers. However, the code snippets given are only constructors of various contracts and do not include any functions that actually perform token transfers.

To fully comply with the rule, the contract should include an event definition for Transfer and emit that event in functions where tokens are transferred. For example, in an ERC20 token contract, you would typically see something like this:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(_to != address(0));
    require(_value <= balances[msg.sender]);

    // SafeMath.sub will throw if there is not enough balance.
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

Since the provided code does not include any transfer logic or event emissions, it does not violate the rule directly, but it also does not demonstrate compliance with the rule. The actual compliance would depend on the implementation of the transfer-related functions, which are not included in the provided code snippets.
