NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not call any external callee that returns a boolean value (`bool success`). The function itself performs a series of checks and operations internally and returns a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer operation. It does not depend on the result of any external calls to determine its return value. Therefore, it does not violate the given rule.
