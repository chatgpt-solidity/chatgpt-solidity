NO

The provided Solidity function `HBToken` and its related parts do not violate the given rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they call any callee that returns a boolean success value.

In the provided code snippet, the `HBToken` function is a constructor for the `HBToken` contract, which inherits from `UnboundedRegularToken` (though the code for `UnboundedRegularToken` is not provided, we can assume it inherits from `RegularToken` based on the context). The constructor initializes the total supply of tokens and assigns them to the creator of the contract. It also emits a `Transfer` event to signal the transfer of tokens from the zero address to the contract creator.

The `Transfer` event does not return a boolean value; it is simply an event emission. Therefore, there is no boolean success value to handle or return, and the rule does not apply to this situation.

The `balances` mapping in the `RegularToken` contract is used to keep track of token balances, and it is updated directly without a function call that returns a boolean value.

Since there are no calls to any functions that return a boolean success value in the provided code, the rule is not violated.
