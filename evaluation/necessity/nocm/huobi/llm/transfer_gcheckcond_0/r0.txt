NO

The function `transfer` in the provided Solidity code does not call any other functions that return a boolean value. It only performs internal checks and state updates within the contract itself. The rule provided is concerned with handling or directly returning the result of calls to other functions that return a boolean value (`bool success`). Since the `transfer` function does not make such calls, it does not violate the given rule.
