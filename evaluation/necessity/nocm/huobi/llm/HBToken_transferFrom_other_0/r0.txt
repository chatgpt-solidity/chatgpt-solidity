NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not explicitly violate the ERC-20 rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The function does not contain any condition that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated like any other transfer. If `_value` is 0, the function would still check the balance and allowance, update the balances and allowances if necessary (though there would be no actual change), and emit a Transfer event, just as it would for a transfer of more than 0. Therefore, it complies with the ERC rule mentioned.
