The function `finalize` does not handle or directly return the result of the call to `ethFundDeposit.send(this.balance)`. Instead, it uses a throw statement to revert the transaction if the send operation fails. This is an older pattern used in Solidity before the introduction of `require` statements, which are now recommended for handling errors because they provide more gas efficiency and better error messaging.

The `throw` statement will revert all changes if the send operation fails, but it does not return the result of the send operation to the caller. The rule requires that the caller handles or directly returns the result of calls that return a boolean success value, which is not the case here.
