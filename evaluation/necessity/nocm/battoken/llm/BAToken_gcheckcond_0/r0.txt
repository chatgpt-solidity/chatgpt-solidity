NO

The provided Solidity function `BAToken` (which is a constructor for the `BAToken` contract) and its related parts do not make any external calls that return a boolean value (`bool success`). The constructor simply initializes state variables and sets the initial balance for the `batFundDeposit` address. There are no calls to external contracts or functions that return a success value that would need to be handled or directly returned according to the rule provided.
