NO

The function `transferFrom` in the provided Solidity code checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 before proceeding with the transfer. This means that a transfer of 0 value would not be treated as a normal transfer and would return false, which violates the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The condition `_value > 0` should be removed to comply with the ERC rule.
