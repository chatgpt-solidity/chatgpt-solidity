NO

The provided Solidity code for the `ERC20` contract does not violate the specified rule. The rule states that an `Approval` event should be emitted if there is any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`. 

In the given code, the `_approve` internal function is responsible for setting the allowance and emitting the `Approval` event. This function is called within the `_spendAllowance` function, which is in turn called by the `transferFrom` function when the allowance is not the maximum `uint256`. The `Approval` event is correctly emitted in the `_approve` function, which complies with the rule.

The `transferFrom` function itself does not directly emit the `Approval` event, but it does so indirectly through the `_spendAllowance` and `_approve` functions when the allowance is adjusted. This is the expected behavior according to the ERC-20 standard, and it does not violate the rule provided.
