NO

The `decreaseAllowance` function does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean indicating success that needs to be handled or directly returned. It only calls an internal function `_approve`, which does not return any value, and the `require` statements used in the function are not calls to external contracts but rather checks that throw an exception if the condition is not met. Therefore, the function does not violate the given rule.
