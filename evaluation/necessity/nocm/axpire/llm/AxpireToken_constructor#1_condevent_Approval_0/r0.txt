NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any implementation of the `approve` function, which is typically part of an ERC-20 token contract. The `approve` function is used to allow another address to withdraw a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the token owner.

The rule you've provided states that the `Approval` event should be emitted if there is a successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`. Since the `approve` function is not included in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine whether the rule is violated or not.

However, it's important to note that the `emit` keyword is not used in the provided constructor function when emitting the `CreateToken` event. This is acceptable because the code is written for Solidity version 0.4.24, which predates the requirement to use the `emit` keyword for emitting events (introduced in Solidity 0.4.21). The comment in the notes section indicates that the absence of the `emit` keyword is not a violation for this version of Solidity.
