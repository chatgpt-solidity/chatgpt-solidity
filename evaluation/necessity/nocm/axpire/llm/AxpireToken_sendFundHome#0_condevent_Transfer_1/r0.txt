The function `sendFundHome` in the provided Solidity code is designed to send Ether (ETH), not tokens. The rule you've provided pertains to the transfer of tokens and the requirement to emit a `Transfer` event when tokens are transferred. Since the function is dealing with ETH and not with token transfers, it does not violate the rule of emitting a `Transfer` event for token transfers. The function is simply sending the balance of Ether held by the contract to the `ethFundDeposit` address and does not involve any token transfer logic.
