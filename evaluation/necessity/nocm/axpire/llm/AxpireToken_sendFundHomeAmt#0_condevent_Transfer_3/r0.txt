YES

The function `sendFundHomeAmt` in the provided Solidity code sends Ether to the address `ethFundDeposit`, but it does not emit any event indicating that tokens are being burned or deallocated. Since the rule states that a Transfer event should be emitted if tokens are burning or deallocating, and the function is dealing with Ether rather than tokens, it does not directly violate the rule as stated.

However, if the intention was to also handle token transfers within this function, then it would indeed violate the rule by not emitting a Transfer event. The code provided does not show any token transfer logic or the Transfer event definition, so based on the given information, the function does not violate the specific rule regarding emitting a Transfer event for token burn or deallocation.
