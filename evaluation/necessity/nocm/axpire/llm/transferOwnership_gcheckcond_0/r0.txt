NO

The function `transferOwnership` does not call any callee that returns a boolean value (`bool success`). It only contains a `require` statement to check that the new owner's address is not the zero address, and an assignment operation to change the `owner` state variable. There is also an event emission `OwnershipTransferred` to log the ownership transfer, but this does not return a boolean either. Therefore, the function does not violate the given rule.
