NO

The function `sendFundHome` in the provided Solidity code is designed to send Ether (ETH) from the contract to the `ethFundDeposit` address, which is presumably a wallet controlled by the owner or the organization behind the contract. This function does not deal with the transfer, burn, or deallocation of tokens; it is solely concerned with the transfer of Ether.

The rule provided states that a Transfer event should be emitted if tokens are burning or deallocating. Since the `sendFundHome` function does not involve token transfers, burning, or deallocation, it does not violate the rule of emitting a Transfer event in those cases.

Therefore, the answer is NO, the function `sendFundHome` and the related parts do not violate the rule provided.
