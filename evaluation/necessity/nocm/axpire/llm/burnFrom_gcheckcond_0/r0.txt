The `burnFrom` function does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean indicating success or failure that needs to be handled or returned. It only performs internal state changes using the `SafeMath.sub` function, which either returns the result of the subtraction or throws an error if the subtraction would result in an overflow. The `require` statements are used to validate conditions before proceeding with the state changes, and they will revert the transaction if any condition is not met. There is no boolean success value to handle or return in this function.
