NO

The provided `transfer` function in the `StandardToken` contract does not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The function checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 and if the sender has enough balance to make the transfer. If `_value` is 0, the condition `_value > 0` will fail, and the function will return false, which is not in compliance with the ERC rule that requires treating transfers of 0 values as normal transfers.

However, the function does not revert or throw an error; it simply returns false, which could be interpreted as a non-standard behavior but not necessarily a violation of the ERC rule. The ERC rule requires that a transfer of 0 value should be treated as a normal transfer, which implies that it should emit a Transfer event and return true. The provided function does not do this, so it does not fully comply with the ERC rule.
