NO

The function `sendFundHomeAmt` in the provided Solidity code does not appear to transfer any tokens; instead, it seems to be sending Ether (since it's using the `.send` method on an Ethereum address). The rule provided states that a Transfer event should be emitted if tokens are transferred, but this function does not involve token transfers, so the rule does not apply in this context.

However, it's worth noting that the code provided is incomplete and does not show any events or the implementation of the `AxpirePausableToken` contract. If the `AxpirePausableToken` contract includes token transfer functionality and does not emit a Transfer event when tokens are transferred, then it would be in violation of the rule. But based on the given function `sendFundHomeAmt` alone, the rule is not violated.
