NO

The `transfer` function in the `AxpirePausableToken` contract correctly handles the return value from the `super.transfer(_to, _value)` call by directly returning it. The `super.transfer` call returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation, and this value is directly returned by the `transfer` function in `AxpirePausableToken`. Therefore, the function and its related parts do not violate the given rule.
