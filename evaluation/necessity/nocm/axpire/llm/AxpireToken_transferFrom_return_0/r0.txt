YES

The `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful or not, as per the ERC rule. If the conditions are met (sufficient balance and allowance, and the value to transfer is greater than 0), the function performs the transfer, emits a `Transfer` event, and returns `true`. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns `false`.

The `AxpirePausableToken` contract, which inherits from `StandardToken`, overrides the `transferFrom` function but adds the `whenNotPaused` modifier from the `Pausable` contract. This modifier ensures that the function can only be called when the contract is not paused. If the contract is paused, the function will revert due to the `require` statement in the `whenNotPaused` modifier. If the contract is not paused, it calls the `transferFrom` function from the `StandardToken` contract using `super.transferFrom` and returns its result, which adheres to the ERC rule of returning whether the transfer is successful.
