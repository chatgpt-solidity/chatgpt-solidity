NO

The provided `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 before proceeding with the transfer:

```solidity
if (
    balances[_from] >= _value &&
    allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value &&
    _value > 0
)
```

This condition ensures that the transfer will only occur if the `_value` is greater than 0, which is in compliance with the ERC rule stating that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The function does not reject a transfer of 0 value; it treats it as a normal transfer and would return `true` if all other conditions are met (sufficient balance and allowance).
