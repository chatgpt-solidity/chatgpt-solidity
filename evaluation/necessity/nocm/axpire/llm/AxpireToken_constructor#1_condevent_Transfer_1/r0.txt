NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly show a Transfer event being emitted in the constructor of the AxpireToken contract when the initial token balance is assigned to the escrowFundDeposit address. According to the rule that states "Emit Transfer if tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers," the contract should emit a Transfer event whenever tokens are transferred or balances are updated, which includes the initial distribution of tokens.

However, the code snippet provided does not include the definition of the "CreateToken" event or any "Transfer" event. If the "CreateToken" event is not equivalent to the "Transfer" event and does not serve the same purpose, then the code would indeed be violating the rule. If the "CreateToken" event is intended to signal token creation and not a token transfer, then a separate "Transfer" event should be emitted to comply with the rule.

In Solidity, the standard practice for ERC-20 tokens is to emit a Transfer event with the from address set to the zero address (address(0)) to indicate that tokens are being created and assigned to an account. The code should include something like this:

```solidity
emit Transfer(address(0), escrowFundDeposit, totalSupply);
```

This line should be added to the constructor to comply with the rule, assuming that the "CreateToken" event is not an alias for the "Transfer" event. Since the code does not show this, it is not following the rule as stated.
