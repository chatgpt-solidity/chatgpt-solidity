YES

The `createTokens` function in the provided Solidity code does indeed transfer tokens to the `msg.sender` by increasing their balance with the line `balances[msg.sender] += tokens;`. However, the code does not emit a `Transfer` event after updating the balance, which is required by the rule to log token transfers, including zero value transfers.

The `Transfer` event is a standard event defined in the ERC-20 token standard, which should be emitted whenever tokens are transferred, including when new tokens are created and assigned to a user. The absence of this event emission is a violation of the rule provided.

The `CreateToken` event is emitted, but this is not a substitute for the `Transfer` event. The `Transfer` event should have the signature `Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)` and should be emitted with `_from` as the zero address (indicating token creation) and `_to` as the recipient's address.

The code should include something like the following after updating the balance:

```solidity
emit Transfer(0x0, msg.sender, tokens);
```

This line would correctly emit the `Transfer` event, indicating that `tokens` amount of new tokens have been transferred from the zero address (indicating creation) to `msg.sender`.
