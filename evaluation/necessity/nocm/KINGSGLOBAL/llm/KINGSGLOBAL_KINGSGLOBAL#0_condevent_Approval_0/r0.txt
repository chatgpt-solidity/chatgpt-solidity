NO

The provided code snippet does not include the `approve` function or any event emission related to the `Approval` event. The rule specifies that the `Approval` event should be emitted if there is a successful call to the `approve` function. Since the `approve` function is not part of the provided code, we cannot determine whether the rule is violated based on the given information.

To fully assess compliance with the rule, the implementation of the `approve` function and the associated event emission would need to be reviewed. If the `approve` function exists elsewhere in the contract and does not emit the `Approval` event upon a successful call, then it would violate the rule. However, this cannot be determined from the provided snippet.
