NO

The provided function `KINGSGLOBAL()` (which is a constructor for the `KINGSGLOBAL` contract) does not make any external calls that return a boolean value (`bool success`). The constructor is simply initializing state variables and does not interact with any external contracts or functions that would return a success flag. Therefore, it does not violate the given rule.
