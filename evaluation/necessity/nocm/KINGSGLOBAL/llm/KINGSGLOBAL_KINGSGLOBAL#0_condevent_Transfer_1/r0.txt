YES

The provided function `KINGSGLOBAL()` (which is a constructor for the `KINGSGLOBAL` contract) initializes the balances by crediting the `msg.sender` with a certain amount of tokens. This is effectively a transfer of tokens from the contract to `msg.sender`. According to the rule that states "Emit Transfer if tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers," the constructor should emit a Transfer event to reflect this initial distribution of tokens.

However, the provided code snippet does not show any Transfer event being emitted within the constructor. Even though the code is written for Solidity version 0.4.25, which does not require the `emit` keyword for emitting events, the actual event emission code is still missing.

Therefore, the function `KINGSGLOBAL()` violates the rule as it does not emit a Transfer event upon transferring the initial token balance to `msg.sender`.
