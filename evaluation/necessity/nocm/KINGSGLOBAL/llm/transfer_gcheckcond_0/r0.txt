NO

The function `transfer` in the provided Solidity code does not call any other functions that return a boolean value (`bool success`). It only performs operations within its own contract's state, specifically updating the `balances` mapping after checking the sender's balance. The function itself returns a boolean value to indicate the success of the transfer, which is in line with the rule provided. The rule is concerned with handling or returning the result of calls to other functions that return a boolean, but since there are no such calls within the `transfer` function, the rule is not violated.
