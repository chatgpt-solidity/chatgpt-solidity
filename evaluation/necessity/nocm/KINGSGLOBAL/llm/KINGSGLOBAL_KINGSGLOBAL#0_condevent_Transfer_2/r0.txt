YES

The function `KINGSGLOBAL()` in the provided Solidity code is the constructor for the `KINGSGLOBAL` contract, which inherits from `StandardToken`. In this constructor, an initial balance is set for the `msg.sender` address, which implies that tokens are being minted or allocated to the `msg.sender`. However, there is no `Transfer` event being emitted to reflect this token allocation as per the rule provided.

In Solidity, especially before version 0.5, it was common to define events and emit them to log the transactions of tokens. The `Transfer` event is a standard event for ERC-20 tokens that should be emitted whenever tokens are transferred, including during minting or allocation. The absence of an `emit` statement for the `Transfer` event when tokens are being minted or allocated is a violation of the rule provided.

Therefore, the answer is YES, the function `KINGSGLOBAL` and the related parts violate the rule that states "Emit Transfer if tokens are minting or allocating."
