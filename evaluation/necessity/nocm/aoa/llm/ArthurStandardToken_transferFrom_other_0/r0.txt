NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The condition `_value > 0` is not excluding the possibility of transferring a value of 0; it is simply part of the checks to ensure that the `_from` account has enough balance and the `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer the specified `_value`. If `_value` is 0, the function will still proceed with the transfer as long as the other conditions are met (i.e., the `_from` account has enough balance and allowance for `msg.sender`), thus treating a transfer of 0 value as a normal transfer.
