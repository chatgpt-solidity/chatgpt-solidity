YES

The given `transfer` function violates the ERC-20 rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The condition in the function:

```solidity
if (balances[msg.sender] >= _value && _value > 0) {
```

explicitly checks if `_value > 0`, which means that if `_value` is 0, the function will return `false` and not proceed with the transfer. According to the ERC-20 rule, the function should allow transfers of 0 values and treat them as normal transfers, emitting the Transfer event accordingly.
