YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided code includes the following line:

```solidity
require(_value > 0);
```

This line requires that the `_value` (the amount to be transferred) must be greater than 0. This violates the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers," because it prevents transfers of 0 value from being processed. According to the ERC rule, the function should allow transfers of 0 value to be treated the same as any other transfer.
