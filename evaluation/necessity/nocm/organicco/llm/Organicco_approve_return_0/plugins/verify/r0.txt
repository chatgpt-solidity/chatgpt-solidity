Certainly, let's go through the `approve` function step by step to understand why the return value does not violate the given rule:

1. **Function Signature**: The `approve` function takes two parameters: an address `_spender` and a uint `_value`. It is declared to return a boolean value.

2. **Setting Allowance**:
   - The function sets the allowance for `_spender` to spend `_value` tokens on behalf of the `msg.sender`.
   - It does this by accessing the `_allowances` mapping, which is a two-dimensional mapping of addresses to allowances.
   - The current allowance is retrieved and then the `_value` is added to it using the `SafeMath.add` function.

3. **SafeMath Library**:
   - The `SafeMath.add` function is used to safely add two uint256 numbers and prevent overflow.
   - If the addition does not cause an overflow, the function returns the sum.
   - If there is an overflow, the `assert` statement in `SafeMath.add` will cause the transaction to revert, and no further code in the `approve` function will be executed.

4. **Emitting Approval Event**:
   - After the allowance is updated, the `Approval` event is emitted with the `msg.sender`, `_spender`, and `_value` as arguments.
   - This event is a standard part of the ERC20 token specification and is used to log the approval action.

5. **Returning True**:
   - Finally, the function returns `true`, indicating that the approval was successful.

6. **No Checks for Actual Success**:
   - The function does not perform any checks to confirm that the `_spender` is a valid address or that the approval makes sense within the context of the contract's state (e.g., the `_spender` is not already allowed to spend the entire balance, etc.).
   - It relies on the `SafeMath.add` function to prevent overflow, but beyond that, it assumes that the approval is always successful.

7. **Rule Compliance**:
   - The rule provided states that the function should "Return whether the approve is successful."
   - Since the function is designed to always return `true` and does not contain any logic that could lead to a return value of `false`, it complies with the rule by always indicating that the approval was successful.

In conclusion, the `approve` function does not violate the given rule because it is structured to always return `true`, indicating that the approval is successful, regardless of any other conditions or potential issues that are not checked within the function.
