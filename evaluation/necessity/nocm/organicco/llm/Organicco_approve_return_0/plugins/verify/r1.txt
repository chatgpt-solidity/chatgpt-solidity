NO

The explanation provided does not support the original answer. Let's go through the explanation step by step to clarify:

1. The `approve` function is intended to set the allowance for `_spender` to spend `_value` tokens on behalf of `msg.sender`.

2. The function uses the `SafeMath.add` library function to safely add the new `_value` to the current allowance to prevent overflow errors.

3. The `Approval` event is emitted to log the approval action on the blockchain.

4. The function returns `true` unconditionally, which implies that the approval was successful.

However, the rule provided states that the function should "Return whether the approve is successful." The function does not include any checks to confirm that the approval was actually successful; it simply assumes success and returns `true`. This could be misleading if, for example, the approval was not needed because the `_value` was zero, or if there were other business logic conditions that should have been checked.

The correct step-by-step explanation should conclude that the function does not comply with the rule because it does not validate the success of the approval operation; it only assumes success without any checks. Therefore, the function could potentially return `true` even in cases where the approval might not be considered successful according to the intended business logic or additional conditions that are not checked within the function.
