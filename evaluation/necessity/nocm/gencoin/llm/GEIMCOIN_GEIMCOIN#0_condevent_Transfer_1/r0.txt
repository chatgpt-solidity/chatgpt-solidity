YES

The function `GEIMCOIN()` in the provided Solidity code initializes the contract by setting the initial balance of the creator's address (`msg.sender`) to a certain amount of tokens. According to the rule provided, a `Transfer` event should be emitted whenever tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

However, the provided code snippet does not show the emission of a `Transfer` event within the `GEIMCOIN()` constructor function after setting the initial balance. This omission violates the rule that requires the emission of a `Transfer` event upon token transfer.

It's important to note that the code snippet is incomplete and does not include the definition of the `Token` contract from which `StandardToken` inherits, nor does it show the `Transfer` event declaration. However, based on the information given and the rule provided, the lack of an `emit` statement for the `Transfer` event in the constructor function is a violation.
