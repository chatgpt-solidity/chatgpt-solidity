Given a solidity function approve and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function approve and the related parts violate the rule? Replay in "YES" or "NO".
Notes: Before Solidity version 0.5, events are emitting without "emit" keyword.

Example of "initial token distribution" are provided below. 
Example:"""
construct <Contract Name> {
    constructor() {
        // tokens are transfer during the initial token distribution:
        balances[msg.sender] = total;
    }
}
"""



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
pragma solidity 0.4.25;
contract StandardToken is Token {

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) allowed;
}
"""

Rule:"""
Emit Transfer if tokens are transferred during the initial token distribution or crowdsale.
