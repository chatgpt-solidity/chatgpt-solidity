NO

The provided code snippet does not include the `approve` function or the `Approval` event, which are typically part of an ERC-20 token contract. The rule states that the `Approval` event should be emitted upon a successful call to the `approve` function. Since the `approve` function and the related `Approval` event are not part of the provided code, we cannot determine whether the rule is violated based on the given information.

To fully audit the contract for compliance with the rule, the complete implementation of the `approve` function and the `Approval` event declaration would need to be reviewed.
