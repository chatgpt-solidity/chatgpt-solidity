NO

The provided Solidity function KIMEX and the related parts from the smart contract do not show any token transfer logic. The function KIMEX is a constructor for the contract, which initializes state variables but does not perform any token transfers. The rule that requires emitting a Transfer event applies when actual token transfer operations occur, such as in functions that transfer tokens from one address to another.

Since the code snippet provided does not include any token transfer operations, it does not violate the rule regarding emitting Transfer events. However, it's important to note that the full contract is not provided, and the rule could be violated elsewhere in the contract if there are token transfer functions that do not emit the Transfer event as required.
