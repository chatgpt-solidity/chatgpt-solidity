NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any direct calls to external contracts or functions that return a boolean indicating success or failure, which would require handling according to the rule. The only external call in the code is `walletAddress.transfer(msg.value);`, which is a Solidity built-in method for transferring Ether. This method does not return a boolean; instead, it will revert the entire transaction if the transfer fails. Therefore, there is no violation of the rule as stated.
