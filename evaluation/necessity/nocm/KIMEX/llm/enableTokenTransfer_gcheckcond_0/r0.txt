NO

The function `enableTokenTransfer` does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value (`bool success`). It simply sets the `isTransferable` state variable to `true` within its own contract. Therefore, it does not violate the rule as there are no callee calls that return a boolean result to handle or directly return.
