NO

The provided Solidity function `KIMEX` (which is a constructor for the `KIMEX` contract) and its related parts do not violate the given rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they call any callee that returns a boolean success value.

In the provided code, there are no external calls to other contracts or functions that return a boolean success value. The constructor `KIMEX` only sets initial values for the contract's state variables and checks that the provided addresses are not the zero address using `require` statements, which will revert the transaction if the condition is not met. There are no calls to functions that return a boolean that would need to be handled or returned according to the rule.

Therefore, the function `KIMEX` and its related parts do not violate the provided rule.
