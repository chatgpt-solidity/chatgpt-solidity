NO

The function `enableTokenTransfer` in the provided smart contract code does not directly transfer any tokens. It is a function designed to enable the transferability of tokens by setting the `isTransferable` boolean to `true`. There is no token transfer occurring within this function, and therefore, there is no need to emit a Transfer event according to the rule provided.

The rule states that a Transfer event should be emitted if tokens are transferred during the initial token distribution or crowdsale. Since the `enableTokenTransfer` function does not perform a token transfer, it does not violate the rule.
