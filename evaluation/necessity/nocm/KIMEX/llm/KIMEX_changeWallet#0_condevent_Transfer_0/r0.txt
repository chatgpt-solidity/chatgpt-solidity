NO

The provided function `changeWallet` and the related parts of the smart contract do not violate the rule stated. The rule requires that a Transfer event be emitted if tokens are transferred during the initial token distribution or crowdsale. However, the `changeWallet` function does not transfer any tokens; it simply changes the state variable `walletAddress` to a new address. There is no token transfer occurring within this function, and therefore no Transfer event needs to be emitted according to the rule provided.

The `changeWallet` function is concerned with modifying the wallet address that is presumably used for financial operations within the contract, but it does not itself perform a token transfer. The rule is specific to token transfers, which are not part of the `changeWallet` function's operations.
