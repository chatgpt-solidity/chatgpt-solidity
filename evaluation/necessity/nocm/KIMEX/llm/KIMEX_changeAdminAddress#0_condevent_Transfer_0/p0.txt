Given a solidity function changeAdminAddress and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function changeAdminAddress and the related parts violate the rule? Replay in "YES" or "NO".

Example of "initial token distribution" are provided below. 
Example:"""
construct <Contract Name> {
    constructor() {
        // tokens are transfer during the initial token distribution:
        balances[msg.sender] = total;
    }
}
"""
