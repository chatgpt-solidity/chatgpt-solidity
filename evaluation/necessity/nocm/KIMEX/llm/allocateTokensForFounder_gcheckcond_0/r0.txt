NO

The function `allocateTokensForFounder` does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean indicating success or failure that would require handling or directly returning the result. It only performs internal state changes and emits an event. The SafeMath library's `add` function is used, but it does not return a boolean; it either returns the result of the addition or throws an assertion error if there is an overflow. Therefore, the function does not violate the given rule.
