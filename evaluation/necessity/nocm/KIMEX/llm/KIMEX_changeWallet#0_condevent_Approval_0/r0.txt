The provided function `changeWallet` is designed to change the `walletAddress` state variable within the `KIMEX` contract. The rule you've provided states that an "Approval" event should be emitted if there is a successful call to an `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)` function.

The `changeWallet` function does not appear to be related to the approval of token spending or allowance (which is typically what an `approve` function does in an ERC-20 token contract). Instead, it is a function to update the wallet address associated with the contract, presumably where funds might be collected or managed.

Since the `changeWallet` function does not involve approving a spender or setting an allowance, it does not violate the rule regarding emitting an "Approval" event upon successful calls to `approve`. The rule is specific to the `approve` function, and there is no indication that such a function or an "Approval" event is part of the provided contract code.

Therefore, based on the given function and rule, the function `changeWallet` does not violate the specified rule.
