NO

The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value that needs to be handled or directly returned. The `approve` function itself returns a boolean value, but this is the expected behavior of the ERC20 `approve` function, and it is not the result of an external call. The function simply sets an allowance within the contract's own state and emits an event. Therefore, it does not violate the given rule.
