NO

The provided Solidity function `KIMEX` is a constructor for the `KIMEX` contract, which is used to initialize the state of the contract when it is deployed. The constructor sets up various parameters such as wallet addresses, allocation amounts, and the active state of the contract.

The rule states that the "Transfer" event should be emitted if tokens are minting or allocating. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no actual minting or allocation of tokens taking place within the constructor function. The constructor is only setting initial values for the contract's state variables. There is no transfer of tokens from one address to another, and thus no "Transfer" event needs to be emitted in this context.

For the "Transfer" event to be relevant, there would need to be a function within the contract that explicitly mints new tokens or allocates existing tokens to a specific address, and it is in such a function that the "Transfer" event should be emitted.

Since the provided function does not perform any token transfers, it does not violate the rule as stated.
