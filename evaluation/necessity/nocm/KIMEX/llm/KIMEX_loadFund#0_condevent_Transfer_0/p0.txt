Given a solidity function loadFund and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function loadFund and the related parts violate the rule? Replay in "YES" or "NO".
Notes: Before Solidity version 0.5, events are emitting without "emit" keyword.

Example of "initial token distribution" are provided below. 
Example:"""
construct <Contract Name> {
    constructor() {
        // tokens are transfer during the initial token distribution:
        balances[msg.sender] = total;
    }
}
"""



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
pragma solidity 0.4.21;
contract KIMEX is Owner {
    uint256 public totalLoadedRefund; // Total ether will be loaded to contract for refund

    // Load ether amount to contract for refunding or revoking
    function loadFund() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0);

        totalLoadedRefund = totalLoadedRefund.add(msg.value);
    }
}
