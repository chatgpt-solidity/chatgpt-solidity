The function `enableTokenTransfer` does not mint or allocate tokens; it simply sets a boolean flag `isTransferable` to `true`, which presumably allows token transfers to occur if they were previously disabled. The rule states that the Transfer event should be emitted if tokens are minting or allocating, but this function does not perform either of those actions. Therefore, it does not violate the rule as stated.
