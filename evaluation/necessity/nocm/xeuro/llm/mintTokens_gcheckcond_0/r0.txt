NO

The function `mintTokens` does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value which would require handling according to the rule provided. The only external call is to the `SafeMath.add` function, which does not return a boolean but rather the result of the addition, and it uses `require` to ensure there is no overflow. The function itself returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation, which is in line with the rule.
