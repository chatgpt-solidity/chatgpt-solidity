Given a solidity function addAdmin and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function addAdmin and the related parts violate the rule? Replay in "YES" or "NO".

Example:"""
construct <Contract Name> {
    constructor() {
        // tokens are transfer during the initial token distribution:
        balances[msg.sender] = total;
    }
}
"""



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
pragma solidity 0.5.7;
contract xEuro {

    /* --- administrative variables  */

    // admins
    mapping(address => bool) public isAdmin;

    function addAdmin(address _newAdmin) public returns (bool) {
        require(isAdmin[msg.sender]);

        isAdmin[_newAdmin] = true;
        emit AdminAdded(msg.sender, _newAdmin);
        return true;
    } //
}
"""

Rule:"""
