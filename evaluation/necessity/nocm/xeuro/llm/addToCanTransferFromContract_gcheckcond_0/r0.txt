NO

The function `addToCanTransferFromContract` does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value that needs to be handled or returned. It simply updates a mapping within the contract's own state and emits an event. The function itself returns a boolean value, but this is not the result of an external callâ€”it's a hardcoded `true` value indicating the function's success. Therefore, it does not violate the provided rule.
