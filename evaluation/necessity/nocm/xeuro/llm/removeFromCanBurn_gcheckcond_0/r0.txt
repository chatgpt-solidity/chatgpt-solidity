NO

The function `removeFromCanBurn` does not call any external functions or contracts that return a boolean value (`bool success`). It only modifies the state within the contract itself by updating the `canBurn` mapping and requires that the `msg.sender` is an admin. The function then emits an event and returns a boolean value directly without handling or directly returning the result of any callee function calls. Therefore, it does not violate the provided rule.
