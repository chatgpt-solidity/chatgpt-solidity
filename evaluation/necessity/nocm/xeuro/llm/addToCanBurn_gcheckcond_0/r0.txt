NO

The function `addToCanBurn` does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value that needs to be handled or directly returned. It only modifies the state within the contract based on the `isAdmin` mapping and the `canBurn` mapping. The function itself returns a boolean value, but this is not the result of an external callâ€”it's simply an indication that the function executed successfully. Therefore, it does not violate the provided rule.
