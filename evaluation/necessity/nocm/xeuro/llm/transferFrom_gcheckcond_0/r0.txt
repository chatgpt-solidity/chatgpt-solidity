NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not directly call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value which would require handling or directly returning the result. The only external calls made are to the `SafeMath` library functions `sub` and `add`, which do not return a boolean but rather return the result of the arithmetic operation or revert on failure.

The `transferFrom` function itself returns a boolean value (`true`) at the end, indicating success, but this is the function's own return value and not the result of an external call. The `require` statements used throughout the function ensure that any conditions for failure will revert the transaction rather than returning a boolean value.

Therefore, the function does not violate the given rule.
