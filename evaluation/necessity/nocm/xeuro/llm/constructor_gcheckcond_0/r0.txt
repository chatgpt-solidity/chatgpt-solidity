NO

The provided Solidity function constructor and its related parts do not violate the given rule. The rule pertains to handling or directly returning the result of calls to functions that return a boolean value indicating success. The constructor in the provided code does not make any external calls or interact with any functions that return a boolean success value. It simply initializes several mappings with the address of the contract creator (msg.sender), setting various permissions to true. There are no calls to any external contracts or functions within the constructor, so there is no need to handle or return a boolean success value.
