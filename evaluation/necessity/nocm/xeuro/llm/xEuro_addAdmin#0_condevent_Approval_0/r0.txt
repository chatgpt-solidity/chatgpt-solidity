NO

The provided function `addAdmin` and the related parts do not violate the rule because the rule pertains to emitting an `Approval` event upon a successful call to an `approve` function, which is typically associated with ERC-20 token contracts. The `addAdmin` function is for administrative purposes and does not relate to token approval or the `Approval` event. The function correctly emits an `AdminAdded` event, which is presumably the intended event for this action.
