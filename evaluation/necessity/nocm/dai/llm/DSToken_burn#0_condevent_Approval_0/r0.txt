NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any implementation of the `approve` function, which is where the `Approval` event should be emitted according to the ERC20 standard. The rule provided specifically mentions the `approve` function, but the code given for audit only includes the `burn` function and related parts.

Since the `approve` function and the emission of the `Approval` event are not part of the provided code, we cannot determine whether the rule is violated based on the given information. The `burn` function does not require the `Approval` event to be emitted; instead, it should emit a `Burn` event, which it does correctly according to the pre-0.5 Solidity syntax (without the `emit` keyword).
