The `pull` function in the `DSToken` contract does not handle or directly return the result of the `transferFrom` function call, which returns a boolean indicating success. The `pull` function simply calls `transferFrom` without checking the returned value or passing it back to the caller. This violates the rule that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls that return a boolean indicating success.
