NO

The function `setName` does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value indicating success or failure. It simply sets the `name` variable within the contract. The `auth` modifier uses `isAuthorized` to check permissions, but this is an internal view function and does not involve external calls that return success/failure booleans. Therefore, the function `setName` and its related parts do not violate the given rule.
