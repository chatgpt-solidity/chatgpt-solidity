NO

The provided Solidity function `setAuthority` and the related parts of the smart contract do not violate the rule stated. The rule specifies that an "Approval" event should be emitted if there is any successful call to an `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)` function. However, the provided code does not contain an `approve` function, nor does it mention emitting an "Approval" event. The function `setAuthority` is related to setting an authority for the contract and does not pertain to token approval mechanisms. Therefore, the rule does not apply to the given function and its related parts.
