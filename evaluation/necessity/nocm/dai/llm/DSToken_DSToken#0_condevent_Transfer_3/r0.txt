NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any function that explicitly burns or deallocates tokens. The `DSTokenBase` constructor is initializing balances and supply, but there is no function provided that actually burns or deallocates tokens. Therefore, we cannot determine if the rule is violated based on the given code snippet. To properly audit for this rule, we would need to see the functions where tokens are actually being burned or deallocated to check if the `Transfer` event is emitted accordingly.
