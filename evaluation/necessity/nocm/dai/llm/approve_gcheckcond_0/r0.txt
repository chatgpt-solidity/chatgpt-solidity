The `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract does not call any other functions that return a boolean value. It only calls `super.approve(guy, uint(-1))`, which is a function from its parent contract `DSTokenBase`. However, the return value of this call is directly returned by the `approve` function in `DSToken`. Therefore, the function does not violate the rule as it handles the result of the call by returning it.
