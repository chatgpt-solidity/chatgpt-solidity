NO

The provided code does not include the `approve` function, which is part of the ERC20 standard where the `Approval` event should be emitted. The rule specifies that the `Approval` event must be emitted if there is a successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`, but since the `approve` function is not part of the given code, we cannot determine whether the rule is violated based on the provided information.

To fully audit the contract for compliance with the rule, the implementation of the `approve` function and the associated `Approval` event would need to be provided.
