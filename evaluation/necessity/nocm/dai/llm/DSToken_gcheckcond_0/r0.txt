NO

The provided Solidity function `DSToken` and its related parts do not show any calls to external contracts or functions that return a boolean value (`bool success`). The `DSToken` constructor simply sets the `symbol` of the token and does not interact with any external contracts or functions that would return a success flag. Therefore, there is no violation of the rule as there are no calls that return a boolean to handle or directly return.
