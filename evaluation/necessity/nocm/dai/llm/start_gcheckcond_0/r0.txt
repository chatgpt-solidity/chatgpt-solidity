NO

The function `start` in the provided Solidity code does not make any external calls that return a boolean value (`bool success`). The function simply sets the `stopped` state variable to `false`. The `auth` and `note` modifiers are used for authorization and logging, respectively, but they do not involve calls to external contracts that return a boolean success value.

Therefore, the function `start` and its related parts do not violate the given rule.
