NO

The function `setAuthority` does not call any callee that returns a boolean value (`bool success`). It simply assigns the new authority and emits an event. The `isAuthorized` function does return a boolean, but it is not called by `setAuthority`; it is used in the `auth` modifier to check authorization before allowing the execution of `setAuthority`. The rule is concerned with handling or returning the result of calls that return a boolean, which does not apply to the provided function and its related parts.
