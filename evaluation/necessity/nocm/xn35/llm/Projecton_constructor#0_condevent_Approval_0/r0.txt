NO

The provided code snippet does not include any implementation of the `approve` function or the `Approval` event, which are typically part of the ERC20 token standard. The rule states that the `Approval` event should be emitted upon a successful call to the `approve` function. Since the `approve` function and the `Approval` event are not present in the given code, there is no violation of the rule in the provided code snippet.

However, it is worth noting that for a complete ERC20 token implementation, the `approve` function and the `Approval` event should be included, and the event should be emitted according to the rule. The provided code is incomplete in the context of a full ERC20 token contract.
