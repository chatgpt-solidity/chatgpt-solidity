NO

The provided Solidity code does not show any token burning or deallocating functionality within the given constructor or any related parts. The constructor of the `Projecton` contract simply assigns the total supply of tokens to the `msg.sender`, which is typically the deployer of the contract. There is no transfer of tokens from a non-zero address to a zero address (which would indicate burning), nor is there any other operation that would suggest tokens are being burned or deallocated.

Since there is no token burning or deallocation, there is no need to emit a Transfer event according to the rule provided. Therefore, the function constructor and the related parts do not violate the rule.
