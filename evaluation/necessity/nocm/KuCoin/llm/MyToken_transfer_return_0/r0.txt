The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly return a value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. The code should be modified to return `true` if the transfer succeeds and `false` if it fails. Here's how the `transfer` function should be modified to comply with the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

Additionally, the `require` statements in the `_transfer` function will revert the transaction if any of the conditions are not met, which is a form of indicating failure, but it does not return `false` as per the ERC rule; it simply reverts the transaction without a return value.
