NO

The provided Solidity function `_transfer` and the `transfer` function do not have any explicit checks that would cause them to throw if the transfer value (`_value`) is 0. The conditions checked in `_transfer` are:

1. The recipient address (`_to`) must not be the 0x0 address.
2. The sender (`_from`) must have a balance greater than the `_value` being sent.
3. The recipient's new balance must be greater than their current balance to prevent overflow.

None of these conditions directly check for a transfer value of 0. Therefore, if a transfer of 0 tokens is attempted, none of the `require` statements would fail solely because of the transfer value being 0. The transfer would be processed normally, and the balances would remain unchanged since subtracting and adding 0 has no effect.
