NO

The provided Solidity function `MyToken` (which is actually a constructor for the `MyToken` contract) does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value (`bool success`). The constructor simply initializes state variables within the contract and assigns the initial token supply to the message sender (`msg.sender`). There are no external calls or interactions with other contracts that would require handling or directly returning a boolean result as per the given rule.
