NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` does not directly call any callee that returns a boolean value (`bool success`). The function `_transfer` is an internal function and does not return any value; it only contains `require` statements for validation. If any of the `require` statements fail, the transaction will revert, but there is no boolean value being returned that the caller needs to handle or return. Therefore, the function `transfer` and its related parts do not violate the given rule.
