NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not violate the given rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they call any callee that returns a boolean success value.

In the provided `transferFrom` function, there are no external calls to other contracts or functions that return a boolean success value that needs to be handled or returned. The function itself is designed to return a boolean success value (`true`), which it does at the end of the function after performing the necessary operations and checks.

However, there is a mistake in the code that is unrelated to the rule provided. The line:
```solidity
allowed[_from][msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
```
should be:
```solidity
allowed[_from][msg.sender] = allowed[_from][msg.sender].sub(_value);
```
This is because the allowance should be reduced based on the current allowance, not the balance of the `msg.sender`. This is a logical error in the code, but it does not pertain to the rule about handling boolean success values.
