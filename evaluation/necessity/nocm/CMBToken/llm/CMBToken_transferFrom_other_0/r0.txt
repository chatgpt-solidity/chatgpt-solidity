YES

The given `transferFrom` function violates the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." This is because the function includes the requirement `_value > 0` in the `require` statement, which will revert the transaction if the `_value` is 0. According to the ERC rule, the function should allow transfers of 0 values to be treated the same as any other transfer.
