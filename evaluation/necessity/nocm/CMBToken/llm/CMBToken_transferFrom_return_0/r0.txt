YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. The function uses `require` statements to ensure that the conditions for a successful transfer are met before proceeding with the transfer. If any of the conditions fail, the transaction will revert, and no further code will be executed.

The conditions checked are:
1. The `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer at least `_value` tokens from `_from`.
2. The `_from` address has at least `_value` tokens.
3. The `_value` to be transferred is greater than 0.

If all these conditions are met, the function proceeds to update the balances and allowed mapping, emits a `Transfer` event, and returns `true`.

However, there is a critical bug in the code that would cause the function to behave incorrectly:

```solidity
balances[_from] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
allowed[_from][msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
```

The code incorrectly uses `balances[msg.sender]` instead of `balances[_from]` when updating the `allowed` mapping. This would result in an incorrect allowance being set and could potentially cause the function to revert on a subsequent call due to an incorrect allowance value.

Despite this bug, the function is still designed to return `true` when the transfer is successful, and it will revert the transaction if any of the `require` conditions are not met. Therefore, the return value of the function does not violate the given rule, but the function itself contains a bug that needs to be fixed.
