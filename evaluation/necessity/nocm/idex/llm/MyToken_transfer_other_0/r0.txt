YES

The provided Solidity function `transfer` does not explicitly handle the case of transferring 0 values. According to the ERC rule stated, transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, which means they should be allowed and emit a Transfer event.

The given `transfer` function does not have any condition that checks for a transfer value of 0, so it would not throw an error or revert in such a case. However, it also does not explicitly confirm that this behavior is intended, and the code does not include a comment indicating that 0-value transfers are considered.

To fully comply with the ERC rule and ensure clarity, the function should include a comment or explicit code that indicates 0-value transfers are valid and will be treated as normal transfers, including the emission of a Transfer event.
