NO

The provided Solidity function `transferFrom` does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value. However, it does not reject a transfer of 0 value either. The function will execute normally if `_value` is 0, as long as the sender has enough balance (which is trivially true for a value of 0), and the allowance is sufficient (also trivially true for a value of 0). Therefore, the function complies with the ERC rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers.
