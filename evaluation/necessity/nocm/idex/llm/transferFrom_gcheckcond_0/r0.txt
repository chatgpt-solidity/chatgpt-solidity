NO

The function `transferFrom` in the provided Solidity code does not call any other functions that return a boolean value (`bool success`). It only performs internal checks and state updates within the contract's own state variables (`balanceOf` and `allowance`). Therefore, there is no external callee function call whose boolean result needs to be handled or returned. The function itself returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation, which is in line with the rule provided.
