NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` in the `BasicToken` contract does not call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean value indicating success. The `transfer` function uses the `SafeMath` library to perform arithmetic operations safely, but these operations do not return a success flag; they either complete successfully or throw an error if an assertion fails.

The `SafeMath` functions `add` and `sub` used in the `transfer` function are internal and return the result of the arithmetic operation directly. They use `assert` to ensure that the operation is valid, and if the assertion fails, the transaction is reverted. There is no boolean success value to handle or return.

Therefore, the `transfer` function does not violate the given rule.
