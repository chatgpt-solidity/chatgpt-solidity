NO

The provided Solidity code does not include any implementation of the `approve` function, nor does it include an `Approval` event. The `SilkToken` contract is an extension of the `TokenERC20` contract, which is a basic representation of an ERC20 token. However, the standard ERC20 functions such as `approve`, `transfer`, and `transferFrom` are not included in the provided code snippet.

The ERC20 standard requires an `Approval` event to be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully called. Since the `approve` function and the `Approval` event are not present in the provided code, we cannot determine whether the rule is violated based on the given information.

To comply with the ERC20 standard and the specified rule, the `TokenERC20` contract (or `SilkToken` if it were to override the relevant functions) should include the `approve` function and emit the `Approval` event when the function is successfully executed.
