    constructor() {
        // tokens are transfer during the initial token distribution:
        balances[msg.sender] = total;
    }
}
"""



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
pragma solidity 0.4.17;
contract SilkToken is owned, TokenERC20 {
    bool public isPreSales = false;

    /// @notice Stop presales with setting state variable
    function stopPreSales() public onlyOwner {
        isPreSales = false;
    }

contract owned {
    address public owner;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }
