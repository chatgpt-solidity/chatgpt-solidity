The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to transfer tokens on behalf of another address, given that the sender has been authorized to spend a certain amount of tokens from the `_from` address. The function checks if the `_value` to be transferred is less than or equal to the allowance set for `msg.sender` by the `_from` address. If the check passes, it then deducts the `_value` from the allowance and calls the internal `_transfer` function to perform the actual token transfer.

After the `_transfer` function is called, the `transferFrom` function returns `true`, indicating that the transfer was successful. This behavior is in accordance with the ERC rule that states the function should "Return whether the transfer is successful."

Therefore, the function `transferFrom` returns as the ERC rule required.
