NO

The provided Solidity function `_transfer` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC-20 rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `_transfer` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer. The function checks for the sender's balance, overflows, and whether accounts are frozen, but it does not reject a transfer of 0 value. Therefore, it complies with the specified ERC rule.
