NO

The provided Solidity function `SilkToken` and its related parts do not make any external calls that return a boolean value (`bool success`). The `SilkToken` function is a constructor for the `SilkToken` contract, which internally calls the constructor of the `TokenERC20` base contract. The `TokenERC20` constructor initializes state variables but does not make any external calls or return any values. Therefore, there is no violation of the rule concerning handling or directly returning the result of calls that return a boolean success value.
