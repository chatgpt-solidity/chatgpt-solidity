NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and the internal function `_transfer` do not directly call any external contracts or functions that return a boolean success value. The `_transfer` function uses `require` statements for input validation and state checks, which will revert the transaction if any of the conditions are not met. There are no calls to external contracts or functions that return a boolean indicating success or failure that would need to be handled or returned by the caller. Therefore, the function does not violate the given rule.
