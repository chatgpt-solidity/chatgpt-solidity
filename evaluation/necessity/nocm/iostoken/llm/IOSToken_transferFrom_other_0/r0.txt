NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. However, it does not reject a transfer of 0 value either. The function checks if the sender's balance and the allowance are greater than or equal to the `_value` to be transferred, and if the recipient's balance will not overflow as a result of the transfer. If `_value` is 0, these conditions will be met (assuming no overflow in the recipient's balance), and the function will execute the transfer, reducing the allowance if it is not set to `MAX_UINT`.

Since the function will process a transfer of 0 value as a normal transfer, it does not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers."
