NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly throw an error when the transfer amount `_value` is 0. Instead, it checks if the balance of the `_from` address is greater than or equal to `_value`, if the allowance is greater than or equal to `_value`, and if adding `_value` to the balance of the `_to` address does not cause an overflow.

If `_value` is 0, these conditions will be met (assuming no overflow occurs when adding to the `_to` balance, which is guaranteed for a value of 0), and the function will return `true` without modifying balances or allowances (unless the allowance is not `MAX_UINT`, in which case it will unnecessarily subtract 0 from the allowance).

Therefore, the function will not throw an error; it will simply return `true`.
