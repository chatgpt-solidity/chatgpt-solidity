NO

The provided Solidity function `IOSToken` and its related parts do not violate the given rule. The function `IOSToken` is a constructor for the `IOSToken` contract, which initializes the total supply of tokens and assigns them to the creator of the contract. It also emits a `Transfer` event to signal the transfer of tokens from the zero address to the contract creator.

The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they call any callee that returns a boolean success value. However, in the provided code snippet, there are no external calls being made that return a boolean value. The `Transfer` event is simply an event emission and does not return a boolean success value.

Therefore, since there are no calls to any functions that return a boolean success value, the rule does not apply to this function, and the function does not violate the rule.
