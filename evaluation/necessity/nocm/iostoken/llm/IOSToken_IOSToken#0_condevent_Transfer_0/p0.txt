Given a solidity function IOSToken and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function IOSToken and the related parts violate the rule? Replay in "YES" or "NO".
Notes: Before Solidity version 0.5, events are emitting without "emit" keyword.

Example of "initial token distribution" are provided below. 
Example:"""
construct <Contract Name> {
    constructor() {
        // tokens are transfer during the initial token distribution:
        balances[msg.sender] = total;
    }
}
"""



Function(and related parts) to audit:"""
pragma solidity 0.4.19;
contract IOSToken is UnboundedRegularToken {
    uint public totalSupply = 21 * 10 ** 27;

    function IOSToken() {
        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
        Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, totalSupply);
    }
}

contract RegularToken is Token {

    mapping(address => uint) balances;
}
"""

Rule:"""
Emit Transfer if tokens are transferred during the initial token distribution or crowdsale.
