NO

The function `allowance` in the provided Solidity code does not violate the given rule. The rule states that the caller should handle or directly return the result of calls if they return a boolean value indicating success. However, the `allowance` function does not make any external calls that return a boolean value. It simply returns a `uint` value from a mapping, which represents the amount of tokens that one address (`_spender`) is allowed to spend on behalf of another address (`_owner`). There is no boolean value involved in this operation, and thus the rule does not apply to this function.
