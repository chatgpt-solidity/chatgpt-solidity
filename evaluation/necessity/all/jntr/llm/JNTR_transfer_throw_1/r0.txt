NO

The `transfer` function in the provided code snippet includes several `require` statements that must be satisfied for the function to execute without reverting. Even if the `_value` being transferred is 0, the function will still check if the sender and receiver addresses are allowed (i.e., present in the `allowedAddress` array and marked as active) and if the sender has a sufficient balance (which is trivially true for a transfer of 0 value).

However, if the sender or receiver address is not in the `allowedAddress` array or not marked as active, the `verifyTransaction` function will fail, causing the `transfer` function to revert regardless of the transfer value being 0. Therefore, it is possible for the `transfer` function to throw an error even when transferring 0 value if the sender or receiver does not meet the required conditions.
