YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks if the `_from` address has enough balance and if the `msg.sender` has a sufficient allowance to transfer `_value` tokens. If `_value` is 0, the conditions:

- `balances[_from] >= _value`
- `allowance >= _value`
- `balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to]`

will all evaluate to true because comparing 0 with 0 or any positive number will not cause any issues. The addition of 0 to `balances[_to]` will not change the balance and will not cause an overflow.

Furthermore, if the allowance is less than `MAX_UINT`, the code will subtract `_value` from the allowance. Subtracting 0 from any number does not change the number, so this operation will also not cause any issues.

Therefore, the function will not throw an error when transferring a value of 0, and it will return `true`.
