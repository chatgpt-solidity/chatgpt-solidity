YES

The function `transfer` checks if the sender (`msg.sender`) has a balance greater than or equal to the `_value` they want to transfer, and it also checks for overflow in the recipient's balance (`balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to]`). If both conditions are true, the transfer proceeds.

Transferring a value of 0 would satisfy both conditions:

1. The sender's balance would be greater than or equal to 0.
2. Adding 0 to the recipient's balance would not cause an overflow, and the recipient's balance would remain the same.

Therefore, the function would not throw an error and would return `true`. The `Transfer` event would also be emitted with a value of 0.
