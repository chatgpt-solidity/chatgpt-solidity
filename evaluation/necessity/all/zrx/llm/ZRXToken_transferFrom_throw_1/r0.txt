YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks if the `_value` to be transferred is less than or equal to the sender's balance and the allowance set by the `_from` address for the `msg.sender`. If the `_value` is 0, the conditions:

- `balances[_from] >= _value`
- `allowance >= _value`
- `balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to]`

will all evaluate to true because:

- Any balance is greater than or equal to 0.
- Any allowance is greater than or equal to 0.
- Adding 0 to `balances[_to]` will not change the balance, so the third condition is also satisfied.

Since the `_value` is 0, the code within the if statement will execute, but it will not change any balances or allowances (since subtracting or adding 0 has no effect). The `Transfer` event will still be emitted with a value of 0, and the function will return `true`.

Therefore, the `transferFrom` function and its related parts will not throw an error if transfers of 0 values are attempted; they will execute and return `true`.
