YES

The provided Solidity function `_transfer` and the `transfer` function in the `TokenERC20` contract do not have any explicit checks that would cause a revert or throw if the `_value` (the amount to be transferred) is 0. The function checks:

1. The recipient address is not the 0x0 address.
2. The sender has enough balance.
3. The transfer does not cause an overflow in the recipient's balance.

None of these checks would fail if `_value` is 0. Therefore, a transfer of 0 tokens should succeed, assuming the sender is not on the blacklist and the recipient is not the 0x0 address.
