YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The `SafeMath` library's `sub` and `add` functions are used to prevent overflow and underflow, but these functions will not throw an error when the value being subtracted or added is 0, as 0 is a valid operand for both addition and subtraction in the context of uint256 arithmetic.

The `transferFrom` function checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address, that the `_value` is less than or equal to the balance of `_from`, and that the `_value` is less than or equal to the allowance that `_from` has given to the `msg.sender`. If `_value` is 0, these checks will pass assuming that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the allowance is not negative (which it cannot be due to the nature of unsigned integers in Solidity).

Therefore, if the function is called with a `_value` of 0, and the contract is not paused, and the tokens are not frozen (or the sender is the sale account or the owner), the function should execute without throwing an error.
