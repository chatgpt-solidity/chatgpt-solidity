The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw an error when transferring a value of 0. The `SafeMath` library's `sub` and `add` functions are used to prevent overflow and underflow, but they do not inherently prevent operations with a value of 0.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant parts:

1. The `require(_to != address(0));` line ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address, but it does not restrict the transfer amount.

2. The `require(_value <= balances[msg.sender]);` line ensures that the sender has enough balance to transfer the specified `_value`, including 0.

3. The `SafeMath.sub` function will not throw if `_value` is 0 because the sender's balance would be greater than or equal to 0, satisfying the `assert(b <= a);` condition.

4. The `SafeMath.add` function will not throw if `_value` is 0 because adding 0 to any uint256 value will not cause an overflow.

5. The `whenNotPaused` modifier ensures that the contract is not paused, but it does not relate to the transfer value.

6. The `saleOrUnfrozen` modifier ensures that the transfer is allowed if the contract is not frozen or if the sender is the sale account or the owner, but again, it does not relate to the transfer value.

Therefore, the `transfer` function should complete successfully with a transfer value of 0, assuming that the contract is not paused, the tokens are not frozen (or the sender is authorized to transfer while frozen), and the recipient address is not the zero address.
