YES

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value, and the arithmetic operations involved (addition and subtraction) will not cause an overflow or underflow when dealing with a 0 value transfer. Therefore, the transfer function and its related parts will not throw an exception if a transfer of 0 value is attempted.

The `DSMath` contract ensures safe arithmetic operations, but transferring 0 will not violate the conditions of the `add` and `sub` functions. The `stoppable` modifier from `DSStop` only checks if the contract is stopped, which is unrelated to the transfer value. The `transferFrom` function in `DSToken` will adjust approvals only if the sender is not the source and the approval is not set to the maximum uint value, but this also does not inherently throw an exception for a 0 value transfer.
