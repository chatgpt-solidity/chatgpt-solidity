NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code will throw an error if a transfer of 0 value is attempted under certain conditions. Specifically, the following line of code will cause a revert if `_value` is 0 and `_to` is the contract's address:

```solidity
require(_value >= minExchangeAmount);
```

This line is executed when tokens are being transferred to the contract itself (`_to == address(this)`), and it requires that the `_value` be greater than or equal to `minExchangeAmount`, which is set to 12 xEuro tokens. Therefore, if `_value` is 0, this condition will not be met, and the function will throw an error.

Additionally, the `require(_value >= 0);` statement is redundant since `_value` is an unsigned integer (`uint256`) and cannot be negative by definition. This line will not cause a revert for a transfer of 0 value, but it is unnecessary and could be removed to optimize the contract.
