YES

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code calls `transferFrom` internally. The `transferFrom` function has a check to ensure that the `_value` is greater than or equal to 0 (`require(_value >= 0);`). Since 0 is allowed, transfers of 0 value will not throw an error due to this check.

Additionally, the `SafeMath` library's `sub` and `add` functions are used to safely subtract and add values without the risk of overflow or underflow. These functions will not throw an error for a subtraction or addition of 0 because:

- Subtracting 0 from any number `a` will not cause `b` to be greater than `a`, so the `require(b <= a);` check in `sub` will pass.
- Adding 0 to any number `a` will not cause an overflow, so the `require(c >= a);` check in `add` will pass.

Therefore, the `transfer` function and its related parts will not throw an error if transfers of 0 values are attempted.
