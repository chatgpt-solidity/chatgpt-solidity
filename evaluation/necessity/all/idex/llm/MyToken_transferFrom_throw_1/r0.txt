YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not have any explicit checks that would cause it to throw if the `_value` is 0. The checks in place are for:

1. Ensuring the sender has enough balance (`balanceOf[_from] < _value`).
2. Preventing overflow when adding to the recipient's balance (`balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]`).
3. Ensuring the transaction amount is within the approved allowance (`_value > allowance[_from][msg.sender]`).

If `_value` is 0, these checks will not fail:

1. The sender's balance will always be greater than or equal to 0.
2. Adding 0 to the recipient's balance will not cause an overflow.
3. The allowance check will pass as long as the approved amount is 0 or more.

Therefore, the function will not throw an exception if `_value` is 0, and it will return `true`. However, it's important to note that the code uses the `throw` statement for error handling, which is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity. The recommended approach is to use `require` for argument validation, which is more gas-efficient because it refunds any remaining gas when a condition fails.
