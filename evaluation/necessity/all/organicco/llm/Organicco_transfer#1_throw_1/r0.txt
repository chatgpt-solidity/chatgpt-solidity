NO

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the sender's balance, and if the recipient is not a contract. If the `_value` is 0, the condition `_value > 0` will evaluate to false, and the function will return false without performing the transfer. Therefore, the function will not throw an error, but it will not proceed with a transfer of 0 value either. It will simply return false.
