NO

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the sender's balance before proceeding with the transfer. If `_value` is 0, the condition `_value > 0` will evaluate to false, and the function will return false without throwing an error. However, it will not perform the transfer, even if transferring 0 value might be intended to be a valid operation in some cases. 

Therefore, the function will not throw an error, but it will also not perform the transfer when the value is 0, which might not be the expected behavior for a transfer function.
