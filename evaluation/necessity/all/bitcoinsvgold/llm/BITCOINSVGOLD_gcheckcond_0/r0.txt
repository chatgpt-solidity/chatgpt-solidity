NO

The provided Solidity function `BITCOINSVGOLD` (which is actually a constructor for the contract `BITCOINSVGOLD`) does not explicitly contain a condition to call any callee that returns a boolean success value. The constructor is simply initializing the state variables of the contract and does not make any external calls or contain any logic that would involve calling another function or contract that returns a boolean.
