YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code checks if the `_from` address has enough balance, if the `msg.sender` has enough allowance, and if the addition of `_value` to the `_to` address's balance does not cause an overflow. If all these conditions are met, the transfer proceeds.

When `_value` is 0, the conditions:

- `balances[_from] >= _value` will be true because any balance is greater than or equal to 0.
- `allowance >= _value` will be true because any allowance should be greater than or equal to 0.
- `balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to]` will be true because adding 0 to any number does not change the number and does not cause an overflow.

Therefore, the function will not throw an error and will return `true`, indicating a successful transfer, even if the transfer amount `_value` is 0. The `Transfer` event will also be emitted with a value of 0.
