Let's analyze the given Solidity code step by step to determine whether the `approve` function emits the `Approval` event:

1. **Solidity Version**: The code specifies `pragma solidity 0.4.22;`. This version is before Solidity 0.5, which means that the `emit` keyword is not required to emit events. Events can be emitted without the `emit` keyword.

2. **Event Declaration**: The code snippet provided does not include the declaration of the `Approval` event. In Solidity, events must be declared before they can be emitted. Since the event declaration is not part of the provided code, we cannot assume that it exists within the contract.

3. **Emitting the Event**: The line `emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);` is present in the `approve` function. This line is intended to emit the `Approval` event, indicating that the intention is to emit an event when the function is called.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the `emit` keyword is used, it suggests that the code was written with the intention of complying with Solidity versions 0.4.21 or later, where the `emit` keyword was introduced. However, the absence of the event declaration in the provided code snippet means we cannot definitively say that the event is emitted. For the event to be emitted, the `Approval` event must be declared somewhere else in the contract.

Given that the event declaration is not included in the provided code snippet, we cannot conclusively say that the `Approval` event is emitted. However, if we assume that the event is properly declared elsewhere in the contract, then the answer would be "YES" because the `emit` keyword is used, and the version of Solidity does not require it.

Since the question asks us to make a determination based solely on the provided code snippet and without assumptions about the rest of the contract, the final answer is "NO" because we do not have the event declaration in the provided code.
