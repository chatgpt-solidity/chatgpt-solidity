The provided Solidity function interfaces are meant to be compared against the ERC-20 token standard, which is the most common standard for Ethereum tokens. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement.

Let's compare the provided interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

1. `MyToken(uint256,string,uint8,string) returns()` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It looks like a constructor for initializing a new token contract with a total supply, name, decimals, and symbol.

2. `transfer(address,uint256) returns()` - The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `transfer` function should return a boolean value indicating success. The provided interface does not return a value, which violates the standard.

3. `approve(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

4. `approveAndCall(address,uint256,bytes) returns(bool)` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is an extension that some tokens implement to allow for more complex interactions in a single transaction.

5. `transferFrom(address,address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

6. `fallback() returns()` - The fallback function is not part of the ERC-20 standard. However, it is a common function in Solidity contracts to handle plain Ether transfers. It should not return any value and should be marked as `external payable` if it is meant to receive Ether.

7. `name() returns(string)` - The ERC-20 standard specifies this as an optional function, and it should be marked as `view`. The provided interface does not specify the visibility or return type correctly.

8. `decimals() returns(uint8)` - This is an optional function in the ERC-20 standard and should be marked as `view`. The provided interface does not specify the visibility.

9. `balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard, but it should be marked as `view`.

10. `symbol() returns(string)` - This is an optional function in the ERC-20 standard and should be marked as `view`. The provided interface does not specify the visibility or return type correctly.

11. `allowance(address,address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard, but it should be marked as `view`.

12. `standard() returns(string)` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It seems to be a custom function that might indicate the token standard being implemented.

13. `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard, but it should be marked as `view`.

In summary, the provided Solidity function interfaces violate the ERC-20 standard in the following ways:

- The `transfer` function does not return a boolean value.
- The `fallback` function should not return any value and should be marked as `external payable` if it is meant to receive Ether.
- The `name`, `decimals`, `balanceOf`, `symbol`, `allowance`, and `totalSupply` functions should be marked as `view` and return the correct types as specified in the standard.
- The `approveAndCall` and `standard` functions are not part of the ERC-20 standard.
- The `MyToken` function appears to be a constructor and is not part of the ERC-20 standard.

To be fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard, the contract should be modified to adhere to the specifications, including the correct return types and visibility for the functions, as well as the inclusion of the required `Transfer` and `Approval` events.
