The provided Solidity function `approve` in the `MyToken` contract is intended to comply with the ERC-20 token standard, which is a common standard for implementing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

The `approve` function in the ERC-20 standard allows a token holder to authorize another address (the spender) to transfer up to a specified number of tokens on their behalf. This is useful for enabling other contracts to interact with the tokens, such as when using a decentralized exchange.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should also emit an `Approval` event when it is successfully called. This event logs the approval and is important for off-chain or contract-based systems to track state changes within the token contract.

The provided `approve` function in the `MyToken` contract does not emit an `Approval` event, which means it does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard. To be compliant, the function should be modified to include the emission of the `Approval` event, like so:

```solidity
contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    // Event declaration
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);

    /* Allow another contract to spend some tokens in your behalf */
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value); // Emit the Approval event
        return true;
    }
}
```

Additionally, the ERC-20 standard mentions a known issue with the `approve` function related to the potential for a race condition. It suggests that user interfaces should first set the allowance to zero before setting it to a new value for the same spender. While the contract itself should not enforce this (to maintain backward compatibility), it is something that should be handled by the user interface or off-chain components interacting with the contract.

In summary, the provided `approve` function violates the ERC-20 standard by not emitting the `Approval` event. To comply with the standard, the contract should be updated to include the emission of this event within the `approve` function.
