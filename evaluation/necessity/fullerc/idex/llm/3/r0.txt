The `approveAndCall` function in the provided Solidity code is not part of the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement, and `approveAndCall` is not one of them.

However, the `approveAndCall` function is a common extension to the ERC-20 standard that some tokens implement to allow for more complex interactions with contracts in a single transaction. The idea is to approve a certain amount of tokens for a spender and then immediately notify the spender contract that the approval has occurred, allowing the spender to take action within the same transaction.

The `approveAndCall` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not prohibit additional functions. However, there are a few points to consider in the provided code:

1. The `approve` function should emit an `Approval` event as per the ERC-20 standard. The provided `approve` function does not emit this event, which is a violation of the standard.

2. The `approveAndCall` function should handle the case where the `approve` function returns `false`. The ERC-20 standard states that callers must handle `false` from returns (bool success). In the provided code, if `approve` returns `false`, the `approveAndCall` function will not return anything, which can lead to undefined behavior.

3. The `approveAndCall` function should be marked as `public` and should explicitly specify the return type as `bool` to match the convention of other ERC-20 functions.

4. The `tokenRecipient` interface or contract that defines the `receiveApproval` function is not provided. To fully assess the compliance of `approveAndCall`, we would need to see the definition of `tokenRecipient` and ensure that it does not introduce any violations of the ERC-20 standard.

5. The `approveAndCall` function should be marked as `external` if it is only intended to be called from outside the contract. This can save some gas compared to marking it as `public`.

Here is a revised version of the `approveAndCall` function that addresses some of these issues:

```solidity
// Interface for the recipient contract expected by approveAndCall
interface tokenRecipient {
    function receiveApproval(address _from, uint256 _value, address _token, bytes _extraData) external;
}

contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);

    // ...

    /* Approve and then communicate the approved contract in a single tx */
    function approveAndCall(
        address _spender,
        uint256 _value,
        bytes _extraData
    ) external returns (bool success) {
        if (approve(_spender, _value)) {
            tokenRecipient spender = tokenRecipient(_spender);
            spender.receiveApproval(msg.sender, _value, address(this), _extraData);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    /* Allow another contract to spend some tokens on your behalf */
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }

    // ...
}
```

In summary, while `approveAndCall` is not part of the ERC-20 standard, it does not inherently violate the standard as long as it is implemented correctly and the rest of the ERC-20 required functions and events are properly adhered to. The provided code needed some adjustments to better align with the ERC-20 standard, particularly with respect to event emissions and error handling.
