The provided Solidity code for the fallback function in the `MyToken` contract is designed to prevent the contract from accepting Ether (ETH) by using the `throw` statement. This is an older Solidity construct that has been replaced by `revert()` in newer versions of Solidity. The `throw` statement reverts all changes to the state and consumes all provided gas.

The ERC in question appears to be the ERC-20 standard, which is a widely adopted standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

The ERC-20 standard does not specify anything about receiving Ether directly to the token contract. It is focused on the token functionality itself, such as transferring tokens, approving tokens for third-party transfers, and querying token balances and allowances.

Therefore, the fallback function in the `MyToken` contract does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not mandate the ability to receive Ether. In fact, it is a common security practice to prevent accidental sending of Ether to token contracts, as tokens are not meant to hold or manage Ether unless explicitly designed to do so (e.g., in the case of some ICO contracts or wrapper tokens).

However, it is important to note that the use of `throw` is deprecated in favor of `revert()`, `require()`, and `assert()` in newer Solidity versions for error handling and reverting transactions. If the contract is being written in Solidity 0.4.17 or above, as mentioned in the ERC, it would be more appropriate to use one of these newer constructs.

Here is an updated version of the fallback function using `revert()`:

```solidity
contract MyToken {
    // This unnamed function is called whenever someone tries to send ether to it
    fallback() external {
        revert("MyToken: contract does not accept Ether");
    }
}
```

This updated fallback function will revert any transactions that attempt to send Ether to the contract and provide a clear error message. It is also gas-efficient, as `revert()` refunds any remaining gas to the caller.
