The `procNormalBuyBack` function in the provided Solidity code is intended to allow the owner of the contract to buy back tokens from a seller. The function calculates the amount of tokens to buy based on the `msg.value` (the amount of Ether sent to the function) and the `buyPrice`. It then transfers the calculated token amount from the seller to the owner and sends the Ether to the seller.

To determine if the `procNormalBuyBack` function violates the ERC-20 standard, we need to review the ERC-20 specification and compare it with the implementation details of the function.

Here are some key points from the ERC-20 standard that are relevant to the `procNormalBuyBack` function:

1. The `transfer` function should return a boolean value indicating success or failure.
2. The `Transfer` event must be emitted when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.
3. The `transfer` function should throw if the sender does not have enough tokens to spend.

Now, let's analyze the `procNormalBuyBack` function and related parts:

- The `_transfer` internal function is used to transfer tokens from the seller to the owner. This function does not return a boolean value, but it does throw if certain conditions are not met (e.g., insufficient balance, frozen accounts, etc.). This is consistent with the ERC-20 standard, which requires the function to throw if the sender does not have enough tokens.
- The `_transfer` function emits the `Transfer` event, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard.
- The `procNormalBuyBack` function itself does not directly interact with the ERC-20 `transfer` function, but it uses the internal `_transfer` function to perform the token transfer. This is acceptable as long as the internal function adheres to the ERC-20 requirements when transferring tokens.

Based on the provided code and the ERC-20 standard, the `procNormalBuyBack` function does not appear to violate the ERC-20 standard. However, there are a few points to consider:

- The `procNormalBuyBack` function does not check if the `amount` of tokens calculated is actually available in the seller's balance before attempting the transfer. This could lead to a failed transaction if the seller does not have enough tokens.
- The function sends Ether to the seller using `seller.transfer(msg.value)`. This could potentially cause issues if the seller is a contract that does not handle incoming Ether correctly or runs out of gas. A safer approach would be to use `call.value(msg.value)("")` with proper gas stipend handling.
- The function assumes that the `buyPrice` is correctly set and that the owner has enough tokens to perform the buyback. There should be checks in place to ensure that these assumptions hold true.

It is important to note that while the function may not violate the ERC-20 standard, it could still have other security or logical issues that are not covered by the standard. A thorough audit by a professional auditor is recommended to ensure the contract's security and correctness.
