The provided Solidity function `approve` from the `TokenERC20` contract is intended to comply with the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `approve` function should allow a spender to withdraw up to a certain amount of tokens from the owner's account multiple times, up to the value specified.

The ERC-20 standard also includes a note regarding a known potential issue with the `approve` function:

> NOTE: To prevent attack vectors like the one described here and discussed here, clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before.

The provided `approve` function correctly sets the allowance for a spender:

```solidity
function approve(
    address _spender,
    uint256 _value
) public returns (bool success) {
    allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    return true;
}
```

However, the code snippet provided does not show the `Approval` event being emitted. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `Approval` event must be triggered on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

To be fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should emit the `Approval` event when the allowance is successfully set. The code should be modified to include the event emission, like so:

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);

function approve(
    address _spender,
    uint256 _value
) public returns (bool success) {
    allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value); // Emit the Approval event
    return true;
}
```

Without the `Approval` event emission, the function does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard. It is important to include this event to ensure that all transfers and approvals are trackable by blockchain subscribers, such as user interfaces, wallets, and other contracts that might rely on these events to update their state or user interface.
