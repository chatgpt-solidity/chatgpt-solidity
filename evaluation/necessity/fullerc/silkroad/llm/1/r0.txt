The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and the related parts of the `SilkToken` and `TokenERC20` contracts appear to be an implementation of the ERC20 token standard. To determine if the `transferFrom` function violates the given ERC (which is the ERC20 standard), we need to compare the implementation with the ERC20 specification.

Here are the key points from the ERC20 specification for the `transferFrom` function:

1. Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`.
2. MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
3. The function SHOULD throw unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
4. Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

Now, let's analyze the provided `transferFrom` function:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) public returns (bool success) {
    require(_value <= allowance[_from][msg.sender]); // Check allowance
    allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
    _transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

The `transferFrom` function in the provided code does the following:

- Checks if the `_value` is less than or equal to the allowance set by `_from` for `msg.sender`.
- Decreases the allowance by `_value`.
- Calls the internal `_transfer` function to move the tokens from `_from` to `_to`.
- Returns `true` on success.

The internal `_transfer` function does the following:

- Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
- Checks that the `_from` account has enough balance to transfer.
- Checks for overflows.
- Checks if either the `_from` or `_to` accounts are frozen.
- Updates the balances of `_from` and `_to`.
- Fires the `Transfer` event.

Based on the provided code and the ERC20 specification, the `transferFrom` function seems to comply with the ERC20 standard. It checks for allowances, updates balances, and should fire the `Transfer` event through the `_transfer` function. However, there are a few potential issues and considerations:

1. The `require` statements in the `_transfer` function ensure that the function will throw an error if any of the conditions are not met, which is in line with the ERC20 standard's requirement that the function should throw if certain conditions are not satisfied.

2. The code snippet does not show the actual implementation of the `Transfer` event. To fully comply with the ERC20 standard, the `Transfer` event must be declared and emitted correctly in the `_transfer` function.

3. The code does not show the implementation of the `approve` function, which is relevant to the `transferFrom` function because it relies on the allowance mechanism. The `approve` function must be implemented according to the ERC20 standard for the `transferFrom` function to work correctly.

4. The `SilkToken` contract introduces a `frozenAccount` feature that is not part of the ERC20 standard. While this does not necessarily violate the standard, it is an additional feature that should be documented and understood by users of the token.

5. The code does not handle the case where `_value` is zero. According to the ERC20 standard, transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event. The provided code does not explicitly handle this case, but since there are no checks preventing a transfer of 0, it should still work as expected.

In conclusion, based on the provided code and the ERC20 specification, the `transferFrom` function does not appear to violate the ERC20 standard, assuming that the `Transfer` event is correctly implemented and emitted in the `_transfer` function. However, a full audit would require reviewing the entire contract, including the `approve` function and the `Transfer` event implementation, to ensure full compliance with the ERC20 standard.
