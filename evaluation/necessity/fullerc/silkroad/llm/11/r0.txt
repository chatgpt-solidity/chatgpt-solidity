The provided Solidity code for the `startPreSales` function and related parts of the `SilkToken` contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as specified in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard primarily defines a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to ensure interoperability with other contracts and clients, such as wallets and exchanges.

The ERC-20 standard specifies the following functions and events that must be implemented:

- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`
- `transfer`
- `transferFrom`
- `approve`
- `allowance`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

The `startPreSales` function in the `SilkToken` contract is a custom function that is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is designed to set up a presale mechanism by setting a limit on the amount of tokens that can be sold during the presale and enabling a boolean flag to indicate that the presale is active.

The ERC-20 standard does not restrict the addition of custom functions or mechanisms such as presales, as long as the core ERC-20 functions and events are correctly implemented and behave as specified. However, it is important to note that the `startPreSales` function should not interfere with the standard ERC-20 functions. For example, it should not prevent the `transfer` function from working correctly or alter balances in a way that is inconsistent with the standard.

In the provided code snippet, there is no implementation of the ERC-20 functions or events, so it is not possible to determine whether the `SilkToken` contract fully complies with the ERC-20 standard. To ensure compliance, the contract would need to implement all the required functions and events as specified in the ERC documentation.

Additionally, the `startPreSales` function has a `require` statement that checks if the owner's balance minus the `amtPreSales` is greater than 0. This is a safety check to ensure that the owner has enough tokens to initiate the presale. However, the function does not actually transfer any tokens or record the presale transactions, which would be necessary for a complete presale implementation.

In summary, the `startPreSales` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but the contract must also implement all the required ERC-20 functions and events to be considered compliant. The provided code snippet does not include these implementations, so it is not possible to fully assess compliance without the rest of the contract code.
