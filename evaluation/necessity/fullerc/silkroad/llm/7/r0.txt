Based on the provided Solidity code and the ERC-20 token standard, we can analyze whether the `SilkToken` contract and its related parts comply with the ERC-20 specification.

The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement. Let's go through the key points of the ERC-20 standard and compare them with the provided `SilkToken` contract:

1. **name, symbol, decimals**: These are optional informational methods. The `SilkToken` contract has these variables declared and they are set in the constructor of `TokenERC20`, which `SilkToken` inherits from. This is compliant with the ERC-20 standard.

2. **totalSupply**: The ERC-20 standard requires a `totalSupply` function that returns the total token supply. The `SilkToken` contract has a `totalSupply` public variable, which is equivalent to having a function due to Solidity's automatic getter function generation for public variables. This is compliant with the ERC-20 standard.

3. **balanceOf**: The ERC-20 standard requires a `balanceOf` function that returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`. The `SilkToken` contract has a `balanceOf` mapping that keeps track of balances, and since it is public, it automatically creates a getter function. This is compliant with the ERC-20 standard.

4. **transfer**: The ERC-20 standard requires a `transfer` function that allows token holders to transfer tokens. The `SilkToken` contract does not have this function in the provided code snippet, but it is a required function for ERC-20 compliance. We cannot determine compliance without seeing the implementation of this function.

5. **transferFrom**: The ERC-20 standard requires a `transferFrom` function that allows tokens to be transferred from one address to another on behalf of the token holder. Like the `transfer` function, this is not shown in the provided code snippet, and we cannot determine compliance without seeing the implementation.

6. **approve**: The ERC-20 standard requires an `approve` function that allows a spender to withdraw a certain amount of tokens multiple times. This function is not shown in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine compliance without seeing the implementation.

7. **allowance**: The ERC-20 standard requires an `allowance` function that returns the amount a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner. This function is not shown in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine compliance without seeing the implementation.

8. **Transfer and Approval events**: The ERC-20 standard requires `Transfer` and `Approval` events to be emitted on successful transfers and approvals, respectively. These events are not shown in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine compliance without seeing the implementation.

In conclusion, the provided `SilkToken` contract code snippet shows compliance with some aspects of the ERC-20 standard, such as having `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`, and `balanceOf`. However, without the full contract code, we cannot determine if the contract fully complies with the ERC-20 standard, as the implementations of `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, and the required events are not provided. To fully assess compliance, the complete contract code including these functions and events would need to be reviewed.
