The `approveAndCall` function in the provided Solidity code is not part of the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement, and `approveAndCall` is not one of them.

The ERC-20 standard includes the following functions and events:

- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`
- `transfer`
- `transferFrom`
- `approve`
- `allowance`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

The `approveAndCall` function is an extension to the ERC-20 standard that some tokens implement to allow for a more seamless interaction with contracts that accept tokens. It allows a token holder to approve a certain amount of tokens for a spender and simultaneously call a function on the spender's contract in a single transaction.

The `approveAndCall` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not forbid additional functions. However, it is important to note that the function must still adhere to the security considerations of the ERC-20 standard, such as handling allowances correctly and ensuring that the `Approval` event is emitted when allowances are set.

In the provided code, the `approveAndCall` function calls the `approve` function and then, if the approval is successful, calls `receiveApproval` on the spender contract. This is a common pattern for `approveAndCall` implementations. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. The `approve` function should emit an `Approval` event, as required by the ERC-20 standard. The provided code does not show the event being emitted, but it should be there in a complete implementation.

2. The `approveAndCall` function does not handle the case where the `approve` function returns `false`. According to the ERC-20 standard, callers must handle `false` from returns. The code should check the return value of `approve` and only proceed with the `receiveApproval` call if `approve` returns `true`.

3. The `approveAndCall` function should return `false` if the approval fails, to comply with the standard's requirement that callers handle `false` from returns.

4. The `tokenRecipient` interface and the `receiveApproval` function are not part of the ERC-20 standard and would need to be defined elsewhere in the contract or in another contract. This is an additional interface that must be implemented by the spender contract for `approveAndCall` to work.

In summary, while the `approveAndCall` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, it is an extension and not part of the standard itself. The provided code should be reviewed to ensure that it handles return values correctly and follows the security practices of the ERC-20 standard, including emitting the necessary events.
