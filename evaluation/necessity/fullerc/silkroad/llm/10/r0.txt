The provided Solidity code for the `setPrices` function and related parts of the `SilkToken` contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token must implement to enable interoperability with other contracts and clients. These include:

- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`
- `transfer`
- `transferFrom`
- `approve`
- `allowance`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

The `setPrices` function in the `SilkToken` contract is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is a custom function that allows the owner of the contract to set the prices for buying and selling the token. This functionality is not covered by the ERC-20 standard, which focuses on the transfer and approval of tokens rather than the pricing or exchange rates for buying and selling tokens.

However, it is important to note that while the `setPrices` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, it does introduce additional functionality that is not part of the standard. This means that the `SilkToken` contract is an extension of the basic ERC-20 token with additional features. When introducing such features, it is crucial to ensure that they do not interfere with the standard ERC-20 functions and that they are implemented securely to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

In summary, the `setPrices` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it is an additional feature that extends beyond the standard's scope. The contract should still implement all the required ERC-20 functions and events to be considered ERC-20 compliant.
