The provided Solidity code for the `withdraw` function and related parts of the `ICOToken` contract do not directly interact with the ERC-20 token standard. Instead, the `withdraw` function appears to be designed to allow the withdrawal of Ether (the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network) from the contract to the `icoHolder` address.

The ERC-20 standard, as described in the provided ERC excerpt, specifies a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes methods for transferring tokens, checking balances, and allowing tokens to be spent by third parties. The ERC-20 standard does not cover the handling of Ether or the withdrawal of Ether from a contract.

The `withdraw` function in the `ICOToken` contract does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it is not related to the token-specific functions that the ERC-20 standard defines. However, there are a few points to consider regarding the `withdraw` function:

1. The `withdraw` function does not have an access modifier, which means it is public by default. This could be a security risk if the intention is for only certain addresses (like the contract owner or ICO holder) to be able to withdraw Ether from the contract.

2. The `withdraw` function does not check whether the caller has the right to withdraw funds. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawals if the function is meant to be restricted.

3. The `withdraw` function uses `this.balance`, which is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity. The recommended way to get the balance of Ether in a contract is `address(this).balance`.

4. The `Withdraw` event is emitted, but it is not defined in the provided code snippet. In Solidity, events should be declared with the `event` keyword.

5. The `withdraw` function does not return a value indicating success or failure, which is a common practice for functions that perform critical operations.

6. The code snippet does not show any implementation of the ERC-20 standard methods, so it is not possible to determine if the `ICOToken` contract implements the ERC-20 standard correctly based on the provided information.

In summary, the `withdraw` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it deals with Ether, not ERC-20 tokens. However, the function may have security and design issues that should be addressed.
