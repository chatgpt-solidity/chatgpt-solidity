The provided Solidity function interfaces are meant to be compared against the ERC-20 token standard, which is the most common standard for Ethereum tokens. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement.

Let's compare the provided interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

1. `fallback() returns()` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard. A fallback function is a default function that is called when the contract receives plain Ether without any data.

2. `withdraw() returns()` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It seems to be a custom function for withdrawing funds, which is not required by ERC-20.

3. `transfer(address,uint256) returns()` - The ERC-20 standard requires this function to return a boolean value indicating success or failure. The provided interface does not specify a return type, which is a violation of the standard.

4. `transferFrom(address,address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

5. `approve(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

6. `burn(uint256) returns(bool)` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is a custom function that some tokens implement to allow token burning, but it is not required by ERC-20.

7. `burnFrom(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - Similar to `burn`, this is a custom function not required by ERC-20.

8. `CustomToken() returns()` - This seems to be a constructor or initialization function, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard.

9. `icoHolder() returns(address)` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It seems to be a custom function related to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

10. `icoRatio() returns(uint256)` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard and appears to be another custom ICO-related function.

11. `name() returns(string)` - This is an optional function in the ERC-20 standard and matches the specification.

12. `balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

13. `decimals() returns(uint8)` - This is an optional function in the ERC-20 standard and matches the specification.

14. `symbol() returns(string)` - This is an optional function in the ERC-20 standard and matches the specification.

15. `icoSender() returns(address)` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard and seems to be another custom ICO-related function.

16. `allowance(address,address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

17. `icoEndtime() returns(uint256)` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard and appears to be another custom ICO-related function.

18. `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

The provided Solidity function interfaces include several functions that are not part of the ERC-20 standard, such as those related to an ICO and token burning. Additionally, the `transfer` function does not match the ERC-20 standard because it does not specify a return type. To be fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard, the contract should only include the functions specified in the standard and ensure that the `transfer` function returns a boolean value.
