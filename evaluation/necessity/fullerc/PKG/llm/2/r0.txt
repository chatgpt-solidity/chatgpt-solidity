The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and related parts of the `BaseToken` contract must be evaluated against the ERC-20 token standard, which is the most common standard for Ethereum tokens. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

Let's go through the provided code and check it against the ERC-20 standard:

1. **transfer function**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `transfer` function must return a boolean value indicating success or failure. The provided code does not return any value, which is a violation of the standard.

2. **_transfer function**: This internal function is used to execute the transfer logic. It includes checks for the zero address, sufficient balance, and overflow protection, which are in line with the ERC-20 standard. However, the ERC-20 standard does not require an internal `_transfer` function, so this is an implementation detail.

3. **Transfer event**: The ERC-20 standard requires that a `Transfer` event is emitted when tokens are transferred. The provided code does include a `Transfer` event call, but it is not defined in the provided code snippet. The event should be defined as follows to be ERC-20 compliant:
   ```solidity
   event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
   ```
   The event must be emitted with the correct parameters for every transfer, including transfers of 0 value.

4. **Checking for zero address**: The provided code uses `require(_to != 0x0);` to prevent transfers to the zero address. This is a good practice, but the ERC-20 standard does not explicitly require this check. However, it is commonly included to prevent burning tokens by sending them to the zero address.

5. **Overflow check**: The code correctly checks for overflows using `require(balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]);`. This is in line with the standard's requirement to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

6. **Assert statement**: The use of `assert` to check that the sum of the sender's and recipient's balances after the transfer equals their sum before the transfer is not required by the ERC-20 standard. This is an additional safety check.

To make the provided `BaseToken` contract ERC-20 compliant, the following changes should be made:

- Modify the `transfer` function to return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer.
- Define the `Transfer` event according to the ERC-20 standard, if it is not already defined.
- Ensure that the `Transfer` event is emitted for every transfer, including those of 0 value.

Here is an example of how the `transfer` function should be modified to comply with the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

And the `Transfer` event should be defined at the top level of the contract:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
```

By making these changes, the `BaseToken` contract would be more aligned with the ERC-20 token standard.
