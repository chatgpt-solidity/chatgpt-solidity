The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and the related `_transfer` function appears to be an implementation of the ERC-20 token standard, which is a common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

To determine if the `transferFrom` function and related parts violate the given ERC (which seems to be the ERC-20 standard), we need to compare the provided code against the ERC-20 specification outlined in the ERC document.

Here are the key points from the ERC-20 specification that are relevant to the `transferFrom` function:

1. The `transferFrom` function should transfer `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
2. The function SHOULD throw unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism (typically via the `approve` function).
3. Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

1. The `transferFrom` function checks that the `_value` is less than or equal to the allowance set for `msg.sender` by `_from`, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard.
2. The allowance is then decreased by `_value`, which is also correct.
3. The `_transfer` function is called to perform the actual transfer of tokens.
4. The `_transfer` function checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address, that the `_from` address has enough balance, and that the transfer does not cause an overflow in the `_to` balance. These checks are good practices for security and correctness.
5. The `_transfer` function updates the balances and asserts that the sum of the balances before and after the transfer is the same, which is a strong invariant to ensure no tokens are created or destroyed in the transfer (excluding token minting or burning mechanisms, which are not shown here).
6. The `Transfer` event is emitted, which is required by the ERC-20 standard.

Based on the provided code and the ERC-20 specification, the `transferFrom` function and related parts do not appear to violate the ERC-20 standard. However, there are a few points to note:

- The `Transfer` event should be declared in the contract with the `event` keyword, and it should be emitted with the correct parameters. The provided code snippet does not show the declaration of the `Transfer` event, so it's assumed to be declared elsewhere in the contract.
- The code does not include the `approve` function or the `Approval` event, which are also part of the ERC-20 standard. These would need to be implemented correctly for the contract to be fully ERC-20 compliant.
- The code uses `require` statements for validation, which will revert the transaction if a condition is not met. This is in line with the ERC-20 standard's requirement that the function should throw (revert) under certain conditions.

In conclusion, based on the provided code snippet and assuming that the `Transfer` event is correctly declared and the `approve` function and `Approval` event are correctly implemented elsewhere in the contract, the `transferFrom` function and related parts do not violate the ERC-20 standard. However, a full audit would require reviewing the entire contract code, including all ERC-20 required functions and events.
