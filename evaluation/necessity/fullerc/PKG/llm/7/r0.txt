The provided Solidity code for the `CustomToken` contract and its related parts do not fully comply with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of methods and events that a compliant token contract must implement. Let's analyze the provided code against the ERC-20 specification:

1. **totalSupply**: The `BaseToken` contract includes a `totalSupply` public variable, which is compliant with the ERC-20 standard.

2. **balanceOf**: The `BaseToken` contract includes a `balanceOf` mapping, which is compliant with the ERC-20 standard.

3. **transfer**: The `CustomToken` contract code provided does not include a `transfer` function. This function is required by the ERC-20 standard to allow token holders to transfer tokens to another address.

4. **transferFrom**: The `CustomToken` contract code provided does not include a `transferFrom` function. This function is required by the ERC-20 standard to allow tokens to be transferred on behalf of the token holder by another address.

5. **approve**: The `CustomToken` contract code provided does not include an `approve` function. This function is required by the ERC-20 standard to allow a spender to withdraw a certain amount of tokens multiple times up to the approved amount.

6. **allowance**: The `CustomToken` contract code provided does not include an `allowance` function. This function is required by the ERC-20 standard to return the remaining number of tokens that a spender is allowed to withdraw from an owner's account.

7. **Events**: The `CustomToken` contract code provided does not include the `Transfer` and `Approval` events. These events are required by the ERC-20 standard to be emitted when tokens are transferred and when an approval is granted, respectively.

8. **Optional Methods**: The `CustomToken` contract includes `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` as public variables, which is compliant with the ERC-20 standard as these are optional methods for improving usability.

In summary, the provided `CustomToken` contract code is missing several key functions (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`) and events (`Transfer`, `Approval`) that are required for ERC-20 compliance. To be fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard, the contract must implement all the required functions and events. Without these, the token will not be compatible with wallets, exchanges, and other contracts that expect ERC-20 compliance.
