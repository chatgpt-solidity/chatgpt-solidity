The provided Solidity event interfaces are:

```
event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event Burn(address indexed, uint256);
event ICO(address indexed, uint256 indexed, uint256);
event Withdraw(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
```

The given ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) appears to be describing the ERC-20 standard, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies certain methods and events that a compliant token contract must implement.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the required events are:

```
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

Comparing the provided event interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

1. `event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);` - This matches the ERC-20 `Transfer` event specification and is compliant.

2. `event Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);` - This matches the ERC-20 `Approval` event specification and is compliant.

3. `event Burn(address indexed, uint256);` - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. However, including additional events does not violate the standard as long as the required events and methods are implemented. The `Burn` event is commonly used in tokens that have a burning mechanism to reduce the total supply.

4. `event ICO(address indexed, uint256 indexed, uint256);` - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard and is specific to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Including this event does not violate the ERC-20 standard as it is an additional feature.

5. `event Withdraw(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);` - This event is also not part of the ERC-20 standard. It seems to be related to a withdrawal mechanism, which is not required by ERC-20. Including this event does not violate the standard.

In conclusion, the provided event interfaces do not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the required `Transfer` and `Approval` events are correctly implemented and the contract also implements the required methods as specified by the standard. The additional events (`Burn`, `ICO`, and `Withdraw`) are not part of the ERC-20 standard but do not constitute a violation; they are simply additional functionalities that the contract may offer.
