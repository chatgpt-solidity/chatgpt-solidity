The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions in the `xEuro` contract appears to be an implementation of an ERC-20 token with some additional logic. To determine whether the functions violate the ERC-20 standard, we need to compare the implementation with the ERC-20 specification.

Here are some key points from the ERC-20 standard that are relevant to the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions:

1. `transfer` should transfer `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to` and MUST fire the `Transfer` event. The function SHOULD throw if the caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

2. `transferFrom` should transfer `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event. The function SHOULD throw unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

3. Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

4. The `approve` function allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

- The `transfer` function in the `xEuro` contract calls `transferFrom` internally, passing `msg.sender` as the `_from` parameter. This is a common pattern and does not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the `transferFrom` function behaves correctly.

- The `transferFrom` function has a `require` statement that checks if the `_value` is greater than or equal to 0. This is unnecessary because unsigned integers in Solidity cannot be negative. This line should be removed as it does not add any value and could cause confusion.

- The `transferFrom` function checks if the sender is allowed to transfer the tokens by verifying that either the sender is the `_from` address, the sender has enough allowance, or the sender is allowed to transfer from the contract's address. This is in line with the ERC-20 standard.

- The `transferFrom` function checks if the `_from` account has enough balance to transfer the `_value` amount, which is correct according to the ERC-20 standard.

- The `transferFrom` function has additional logic for when tokens are transferred to the contract itself (`_to == address(this)`). It requires that the sender (`_from`) is the same as `msg.sender`, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard but does not necessarily violate it. This seems to be a custom rule for the `xEuro` contract to handle exchanges of tokens for fiat currency.

- The `transferFrom` function correctly updates balances and allowances, and emits the `Transfer` event, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard.

- The `transferFrom` function has additional logic to handle a minimum exchange amount when tokens are transferred to the contract. This is not part of the ERC-20 standard but is specific to the `xEuro` contract's functionality.

In conclusion, the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions in the provided `xEuro` contract code do not violate the ERC-20 standard. However, they include additional logic specific to the `xEuro` contract's use case. The unnecessary check for `_value >= 0` should be removed, as it does not align with the standard's expectations for unsigned integers. The additional logic for handling exchanges to fiat currency is not part of the ERC-20 standard but does not conflict with it, as long as the standard's requirements are met.
