The provided Solidity function `removeFromCanBurn` and the related parts of the contract `xEuro` do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable token transfers, approvals, and other related functionalities.

The `removeFromCanBurn` function appears to be an administrative function that is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is used to manage a list of addresses that are allowed to burn tokens. The ERC-20 standard does not define token burning; therefore, the presence of this function does not conflict with the standard's requirements.

However, it is important to note that while the function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, the overall behavior of the contract could potentially be non-compliant if the token burning mechanism affects the total supply of tokens without properly emitting a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` (as per the ERC-20 specification for token creation). The ERC-20 standard requires that a `Transfer` event be emitted whenever the balance of tokens changes, including when tokens are burned (effectively transferring them to an address that is considered out of circulation).

To ensure full compliance with the ERC-20 standard, any function that alters the balance of tokens, including burning, should emit the appropriate `Transfer` event. If the `xEuro` contract includes a token burning mechanism, it should be reviewed to ensure that it adheres to this aspect of the standard.

In summary, the `removeFromCanBurn` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but the contract's compliance depends on the implementation of the token burning mechanism and whether it correctly emits `Transfer` events as required by the standard.
