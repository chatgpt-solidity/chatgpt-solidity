The provided Solidity event interfaces are to be compared with the ERC-20 token standard events to determine if they violate the standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies two events:

1. `Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
2. `Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

Now let's compare the provided events with the ERC-20 standard:

1. `event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);`
   - This event matches the ERC-20 `Transfer` event signature and does not violate the standard.

2. `event DataSentToAnotherContract(address indexed, address indexed, bytes);`
   - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. However, adding additional events does not violate the standard as long as the required events are implemented correctly.

3. `event AdminAdded(address indexed, address indexed);`
   - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

4. `event AdminRemoved(address indexed, address indexed);`
   - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

5. `event minExchangeAmountChanged(address indexed, uint256, uint256);`
   - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

6. `event AddressAddedToCanMint(address indexed, address indexed);`
   - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

7. `event AddressRemovedFromCanMint(address indexed, address indexed);`
   - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

8. `event AddressAddedToCanTransferFromContract(address indexed, address indexed);`
   - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

9. `event AddressRemovedFromCanTransferFromContract(address indexed, address indexed);`
   - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

10. `event AddressAddedToCanBurn(address indexed, address indexed);`
    - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

11. `event AddressRemovedFromCanBurn(address indexed, address indexed);`
    - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

12. `event TokensMinted(address indexed, uint256 indexed, uint256, uint256, uint256 indexed);`
    - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

13. `event TokensIn(address indexed, uint256, uint256 indexed);`
    - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

14. `event TokensBurned(address indexed, uint256, uint256 indexed, uint256 indexed, uint256, uint256);`
    - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It does not violate the standard as it is an additional event.

The provided list of events does not include the `Approval` event, which is required by the ERC-20 standard. Therefore, the contract would violate the ERC-20 standard by not implementing the `Approval` event. All other additional events do not violate the standard as they do not interfere with the required functionality of an ERC-20 token. However, for a contract to be fully ERC-20 compliant, it must include both the `Transfer` and `Approval` events as specified by the standard.
