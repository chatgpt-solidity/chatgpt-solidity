The provided ERC is the ERC-20 token standard, which is a common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement.

Based on the ERC-20 standard, a compliant token contract must have the following functions:

1. `totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
2. `balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`
3. `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
4. `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
5. `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
6. `allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)`

And the following events:

1. `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
2. `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

Now, let's compare the provided list of Solidity function interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

- `constructor() returns()` - Not part of ERC-20, but it's a standard constructor.
- `transfer(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `transferFrom(address,address,uint256) returns(bool)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `transferAndCall(address,uint256,bytes) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, but it's an extension for tokens to interact with contracts.
- `transferAllAndCall(address,bytes) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, similar to `transferAndCall` but not standard.
- `addAdmin(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, administrative function.
- `removeAdmin(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, administrative function.
- `changeMinExchangeAmount(uint256) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `addToCanMint(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, minting function.
- `removeFromCanMint(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, minting function.
- `addToCanTransferFromContract(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `removeFromCanTransferFromContract(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `addToCanBurn(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, burning function.
- `removeFromCanBurn(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, burning function.
- `mintTokens(uint256,uint256) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, minting function.
- `mintAndTransfer(uint256,uint256,address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, minting function.
- `burnTokens(uint256,uint256,uint256) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, burning function.
- `canMint(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `symbol() returns(string)` - Compliant with ERC-20 (optional).
- `allowance(address,address) returns(uint256)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `mintTokensEventsCounter() returns(uint256)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `burnTokensEventsCounter() returns(uint256)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `name() returns(string)` - Compliant with ERC-20 (optional).
- `decimals() returns(uint8)` - Compliant with ERC-20 (optional).
- `tokensInEventsCounter() returns(uint256)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `burnTokensEvents(uint256) returns(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `isAdmin(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, administrative function.
- `mintTokensEvent(uint256) returns(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `fiatInPaymentsToMintTokensEvent(uint256) returns(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `tokensInTransfer(uint256) returns(address,uint256,uint256)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `canBurn(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `fiatOutPaymentIdsUsed(uint256) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `canTransferFromContract(address) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `fiatInPaymentIds(uint256) returns(bool)` - Not part of ERC-20, specific to contract logic.
- `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - Compliant with ERC-20.

The provided list of functions includes all the necessary ERC-20 functions, but it also includes additional functions that are not part of the ERC-20 standard. These additional functions do not necessarily violate the ERC-20 standard, but they extend the functionality beyond what is defined in the standard. It's important to note that the ERC-20 standard does not prohibit additional functions; it only specifies the minimum set of functions and events that must be implemented for a token to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

However, the provided list does not include the `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)` function, which is required by the ERC-20 standard. Without this function, the contract would not be fully compliant with ERC-20.

Additionally, the provided list does not include the `Transfer` and `Approval` events, which are also required by the ERC-20 standard. Without these events, the contract would not be fully compliant with ERC-20.

In conclusion, the provided list of functions and the absence of the `approve` function and the required events indicate that the contract is not fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard.
