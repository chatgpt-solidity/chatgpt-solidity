The `mintAndTransfer` function in the provided Solidity code is intended to mint new tokens and then transfer them to a specified address. To evaluate whether this function and the related parts violate the given ERC-20 standard, we need to compare the behavior of the function with the ERC-20 specification.

Here are some key points from the ERC-20 standard that are relevant to the `mintAndTransfer` function:

1. `transfer`: The `transfer` function should transfer tokens and fire the `Transfer` event. It should throw if the sender does not have enough tokens.

2. `transferFrom`: The `transferFrom` function should transfer tokens on behalf of another address, after that address has provided the necessary allowance. It should also fire the `Transfer` event and throw if the sender is not authorized or if the source address does not have enough tokens.

3. `approve`: The `approve` function allows an address to withdraw a certain amount of tokens multiple times from the function caller's account.

4. `allowance`: The `allowance` function returns the amount still allowed to be transferred by a given address.

5. `totalSupply`: The `totalSupply` function returns the total supply of tokens.

6. Events: The `Transfer` and `Approval` events must be triggered on successful transfers and approvals, respectively.

Now, let's analyze the `mintAndTransfer` function:

- The `mintAndTransfer` function first calls `mintTokens`, which mints new tokens to the contract's address and increases the `totalSupply`. This is not directly covered by the ERC-20 standard, as ERC-20 does not specify token minting behavior. However, minting is a common extension to the ERC-20 standard.

- After minting, the function attempts to transfer the newly minted tokens from the contract's address to the `_to` address using `transferFrom`. According to the ERC-20 standard, `transferFrom` should only be used to transfer tokens that have been previously approved by the token holder. However, in this implementation, the contract allows itself to transfer tokens without requiring an explicit approval step, as long as the `msg.sender` is authorized by `canTransferFromContract`.

- The `transferFrom` function in the contract deviates from the standard by allowing the contract itself to transfer tokens without an allowance, provided the sender is authorized by `canTransferFromContract`. This is a non-standard behavior and could be seen as a violation of the ERC-20 standard, which requires explicit authorization through the `approve` and `allowance` mechanism.

- The `transferFrom` function also includes additional logic for handling tokens sent to the contract itself, which is not part of the standard ERC-20 `transferFrom` behavior.

In conclusion, the `mintAndTransfer` function and the related `transferFrom` implementation introduce non-standard behavior that deviates from the ERC-20 standard. Specifically, the allowance and approval mechanism is bypassed for transfers initiated by the contract itself, which could be seen as a violation of the standard. Additionally, the contract includes minting functionality and extra logic for handling incoming tokens, which are not covered by the ERC-20 standard but are common extensions in practice.
