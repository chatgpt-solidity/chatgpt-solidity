The function `changeMinExchangeAmount` and the related parts provided in the `xEuro` contract do not directly interact with the ERC-20 token standard interface. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token must implement to enable interoperability with other contracts and clients. These include functions for transferring tokens, querying balances, and allowing tokens to be spent by approved third parties.

The `changeMinExchangeAmount` function in the `xEuro` contract appears to be an administrative function that allows an authorized user (an admin) to change a parameter within the contract that is presumably used to set a minimum amount for token exchanges. This function does not directly affect the core ERC-20 functions such as `transfer`, `balanceOf`, `approve`, `allowance`, `transferFrom`, nor does it emit the `Transfer` or `Approval` events defined by the ERC-20 standard.

However, it is important to note that while the `changeMinExchangeAmount` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard itself, it could potentially impact the behavior of the contract in ways that are related to the token's economy or exchange mechanisms. For example, if `minExchangeAmount` is used to enforce minimum transfer amounts in the `transfer` or `transferFrom` functions, it could affect how users interact with the token. Such enforcement would need to be carefully considered to ensure it does not introduce unexpected limitations or behaviors that could be seen as non-compliant with the spirit of the ERC-20 standard.

In summary, the `changeMinExchangeAmount` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard as it does not interfere with the standard's required functions and events. However, the broader implications of how this administrative function affects the contract's behavior should be carefully reviewed to ensure it aligns with the intended use and expectations of ERC-20 token holders.
