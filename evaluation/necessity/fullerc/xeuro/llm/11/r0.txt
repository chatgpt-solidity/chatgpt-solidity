The provided Solidity code for the `removeFromCanTransferFromContract` function and related parts from the `xEuro` smart contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable token transfers, approvals, and other related functionalities.

The `removeFromCanTransferFromContract` function in the `xEuro` contract appears to be an administrative function that allows certain addresses to be removed from a list of addresses that have special permissions to transfer tokens from the contract's own address. This is not a function that is defined in the ERC-20 standard, but it also does not conflict with the standard's required functions and events.

The ERC-20 standard requires the following functions and events:

- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`
- `transfer`
- `transferFrom`
- `approve`
- `allowance`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

The `xEuro` contract's `removeFromCanTransferFromContract` function is a custom administrative function that is not part of the ERC-20 standard. As long as the implementation of the ERC-20 standard functions (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, etc.) in the `xEuro` contract adheres to the standard's requirements, the addition of custom administrative functions like `removeFromCanTransferFromContract` does not violate the standard.

However, it is important to note that while the function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, it could potentially impact the behavior of the contract in ways that are not typical for standard ERC-20 tokens. For example, if the `canTransferFromContract` mapping is used to restrict or enable token transfers in a way that deviates from the typical `approve` and `transferFrom` workflow, it could lead to unexpected behavior for users or interfacing contracts that expect standard ERC-20 behavior.

In summary, the `removeFromCanTransferFromContract` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it is essential to ensure that the overall contract behavior remains consistent with the expectations of the standard, especially regarding token transfer mechanisms.
