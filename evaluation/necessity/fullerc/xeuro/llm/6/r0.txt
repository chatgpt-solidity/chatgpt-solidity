The provided Solidity code for the `removeAdmin` function and related parts from the `xEuro` contract do not directly relate to any ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) token standard, as the ERC provided in your question is the ERC-20 standard, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens.

The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable interoperability across different applications and wallets. The functions include `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, and a few others, along with `Transfer` and `Approval` events.

The `removeAdmin` function in the `xEuro` contract is an administrative function that is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is designed to manage the administrative privileges within the contract, specifically to remove an admin from the set of addresses that have administrative privileges. This functionality is outside the scope of the ERC-20 token standard, which focuses solely on the transfer and approval of token balances.

Therefore, the `removeAdmin` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it does not pertain to the token transfer or approval mechanisms defined by the standard. It is an additional feature that the contract developers have included for their own administrative purposes.

However, it is important to note that while the `removeAdmin` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, it must be carefully managed to ensure the security and proper administration of the contract. The function includes a check to prevent the last admin from removing themselves, which is a safeguard to prevent the contract from becoming unmanageable. It is also critical that only trusted addresses are given admin privileges to prevent malicious actions within the contract.
