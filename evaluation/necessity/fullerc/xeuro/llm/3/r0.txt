The `transferAndCall` function and related parts of the provided Solidity code are intended to implement an additional feature on top of the ERC-20 standard, which is described in the ERC-677 proposal. ERC-677 is an extension of ERC-20 that allows tokens to be transferred and a data payload to be sent to the recipient contract in a single transaction. This is useful for cases where a token transfer needs to trigger a function call in the recipient contract.

The ERC-20 standard itself does not define a `transferAndCall` function. Therefore, adding such a function does not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the core ERC-20 functions (`totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`) are implemented according to the specification and the contract behaves correctly with respect to these functions.

However, there are a few points in the provided code that need attention with respect to ERC-20 compliance:

1. The `transferFrom` function should throw an error if the `_from` account has not authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. The provided code does check for this authorization, but it also allows for a special case where the contract itself can transfer tokens if `canTransferFromContract[msg.sender]` is true. This is not part of the ERC-20 standard and could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if not documented and handled properly.

2. The `transferFrom` function should throw an error if the `_from` account does not have enough tokens to transfer. The provided code does check for this with `require(_value <= balanceOf[_from]);`.

3. The `transferFrom` function should throw an error if the transfer amount `_value` is negative. However, in Solidity, `uint256` is an unsigned integer, and the condition `require(_value >= 0);` is always true and therefore unnecessary. This line can be removed.

4. The `transferFrom` function includes additional logic for handling transfers to the contract itself (`_to == address(this)`), which is not part of the standard ERC-20 `transferFrom` function. This logic is specific to the contract's design and should be clearly documented to ensure users understand how it deviates from the standard behavior.

5. The `transferFrom` function includes an event `TokensIn` which is not part of the ERC-20 standard. While emitting additional events does not violate the standard, it is important to document any additional events so that users of the contract are aware of them.

6. The `transferAndCall` function itself is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but as long as it does not interfere with the standard ERC-20 functions, it does not violate the standard.

In conclusion, the `transferAndCall` function and related parts do not violate the ERC-20 standard, but they introduce additional functionality that extends beyond the standard. It is crucial to ensure that these extensions are well-documented and do not interfere with the expected behavior of the standard ERC-20 functions. Users and integrators of the contract should be made aware of these extensions and their implications.
