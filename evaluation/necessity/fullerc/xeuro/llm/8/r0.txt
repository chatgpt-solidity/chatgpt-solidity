The provided Solidity code for the `addToCanMint` function and related parts from the `xEuro` smart contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC excerpt. The ERC-20 standard primarily defines a set of functions and events related to the transfer and approval of token balances. It does not specify rules regarding the minting process or administrative controls such as adding addresses to a minting whitelist.

The `addToCanMint` function in the `xEuro` contract appears to be an administrative function that allows certain addresses (presumably those with administrative privileges) to grant other addresses the ability to mint new tokens. This is a common feature in many token contracts, especially those that are not meant to have a fixed supply.

However, it is important to note that while the `addToCanMint` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, it does introduce additional functionality that is not covered by the standard. This means that the `xEuro` contract is an extension of the basic ERC-20 token. Any additional functionality, such as minting, should be clearly documented and communicated to users and integrators of the token, as it can have significant implications for the token's economics and security.

It is also worth mentioning that the ERC-20 standard does have a note regarding the creation of new tokens:

> A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the _from address set to 0x0 when tokens are created.

This means that if the `xEuro` contract has a minting function that creates new tokens, it should ensure that a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to the zero address (`0x0`) is emitted to comply with the ERC-20 standard. This is not shown in the provided code snippet, so it would be important to review the actual minting function to ensure compliance.

In summary, the `addToCanMint` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but the contract should ensure that any minting of new tokens is done in a way that complies with the standard, including the proper emission of `Transfer` events.
