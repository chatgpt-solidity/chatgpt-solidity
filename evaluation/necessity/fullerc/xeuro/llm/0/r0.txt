The provided Solidity code for the `xEuro` contract does not fully comply with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the given ERC. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of methods and events that a compliant token contract must implement. The `xEuro` contract code snippet provided does not include any of the required ERC-20 methods or events.

Here are the required methods and events according to the ERC-20 standard:

Methods:
- `totalSupply()`
- `balanceOf(address _owner)`
- `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)`
- `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`
- `allowance(address _owner, address _spender)`
- `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)`

Events:
- `Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
- `Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

The `xEuro` contract code snippet provided includes a constructor that sets up administrative roles and permissions for minting, transferring from the contract, and burning tokens. However, it does not include any of the ERC-20 methods or events. This means that the contract, as it stands, would not be recognized as an ERC-20 token by wallets, exchanges, or other contracts expecting to interact with ERC-20 tokens.

To be compliant with the ERC-20 standard, the `xEuro` contract must implement all the required methods and events. Additionally, the contract should follow the behavior specified by the standard, such as handling token transfers, approvals, and allowances according to the rules outlined in the ERC.

It's important to note that the actual ERC-20 compliance would require the full contract code, including the implementation of all the specified methods and adherence to the standard's behavior. The provided snippet is not sufficient to determine full compliance; it only shows that the contract has a constructor and some administrative mappings, which are not part of the ERC-20 standard.
