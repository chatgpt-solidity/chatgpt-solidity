The provided Solidity code for the `approve` function and related parts of the ERC20 contract appears to be compliant with the ERC20 standard as described in the given ERC documentation. The ERC20 standard specifies the following for the `approve` function:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
```

The `approve` function allows `_spender` to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

The provided Solidity code implements the `approve` function as follows:

```solidity
function approve(
    address spender,
    uint256 amount
) public virtual override returns (bool) {
    address owner = _msgSender();
    _approve(owner, spender, amount);
    return true;
}
```

This implementation is consistent with the ERC20 standard. It sets the allowance for the `spender` to withdraw from the `owner`'s account up to the `amount` specified. The function returns a boolean value (`true`), indicating success, which is also in line with the standard's requirement that callers must handle false from returns (bool success).

Additionally, the internal `_approve` function is used to set the allowance and emit the `Approval` event, which is required by the standard:

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

The ERC20 standard also includes a note regarding a known attack vector where the allowance should be set to zero before setting it to a new value for the same spender. However, the standard explicitly states that the contract itself shouldn't enforce this to allow backward compatibility with contracts deployed before. The provided code does not enforce this pattern, which is in line with the standard's recommendation.

In conclusion, the provided `approve` function and related parts of the ERC20 contract do not violate the ERC20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The implementation correctly provides the functionality for token allowances and adheres to the specification for the `approve` function.
