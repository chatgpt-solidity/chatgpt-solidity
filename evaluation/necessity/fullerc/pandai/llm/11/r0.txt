The `increaseAllowance` function provided in the Solidity code is an extension of the ERC20 standard, which is not explicitly defined in the ERC20 specification. However, it does not violate the ERC20 standard as long as it adheres to the expected behavior of allowances within the ERC20 token framework.

The ERC20 standard specifies the `approve` function, which sets the allowance for a spender to withdraw from the owner's account. The `increaseAllowance` function is a convenience function that allows users to increase the allowance of a spender without having to set the allowance to zero first, as recommended in the ERC20 standard to prevent certain attack vectors.

The `increaseAllowance` function in the provided code does the following:

1. It checks that the `spender` is not the zero address.
2. It uses the `_approve` internal function to set the new allowance, which is the current allowance plus the `addedValue`.
3. It emits an `Approval` event, as required by the ERC20 standard when allowances are set or changed.

The function adheres to the ERC20 standard's requirements for the `approve` function and the `Approval` event. It also correctly handles the allowance by using the existing `allowance` function to get the current allowance value and then adding the `addedValue` to it.

In conclusion, the `increaseAllowance` function does not violate the ERC20 standard. It is a helpful addition that can improve the user experience by providing a way to safely increase allowances without the risk of the known "approve" race condition. However, it is important to note that this function is not part of the original ERC20 specification, so it is considered an extension and may not be supported by all ERC20 tokens or interfaces that expect strict adherence to the original methods defined in the ERC20 standard.
