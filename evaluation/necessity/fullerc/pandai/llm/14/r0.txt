The provided Solidity function interfaces are meant to represent the methods of an ERC20 token contract. The ERC20 standard is a widely accepted interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Let's compare the provided interfaces with the ERC20 standard as described in the ERC specification you provided.

The ERC20 standard requires the following methods:

1. `name() public view returns (string)`
2. `symbol() public view returns (string)`
3. `decimals() public view returns (uint8)`
4. `totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
5. `balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`
6. `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
7. `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
8. `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
9. `allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)`

And the following events:

1. `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
2. `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

Now, let's compare these with the provided interfaces:

- `burn(uint256) returns()` and `burnFrom(address,uint256) returns()` are not part of the ERC20 standard. These functions are typically found in ERC20 extensions that allow for token burning, which is a mechanism to permanently remove tokens from circulation. Including these functions does not violate the ERC20 standard, but they are additional features not required by the standard.
- `increaseAllowance(address,uint256) returns(bool)` and `decreaseAllowance(address,uint256) returns(bool)` are also not part of the ERC20 standard. These are convenience methods that can help prevent the known ERC20 allowance race condition, but they are not required by the standard.
- `constructor() returns()` is not a function that is called externally, but rather the initialization code for the contract when it is deployed. It does not violate the ERC20 standard.

All other functions match the ERC20 standard's required methods. However, the ERC specification also requires two events: `Transfer` and `Approval`. These events are not listed in the provided interfaces, but they are essential for an ERC20-compliant token. The contract must emit these events appropriately to be fully compliant with the ERC20 standard.

In conclusion, the provided interfaces include all required ERC20 methods, but they also include additional methods not required by the standard. To be fully compliant with the ERC20 standard, the contract must also implement the `Transfer` and `Approval` events. If these events are not present in the actual contract code, then the contract would not be ERC20 compliant. However, the presence of additional methods like `burn`, `burnFrom`, `increaseAllowance`, and `decreaseAllowance` does not violate the ERC20 standard; they are simply not required by it.
