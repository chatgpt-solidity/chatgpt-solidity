The `balanceOf` function provided in the Solidity code snippet is compliant with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the given ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `balanceOf` function should:

- Accept an address as a parameter (`_owner` in the ERC documentation, `account` in the provided code).
- Return the balance of the specified address.

The provided Solidity code for the `balanceOf` function does exactly that:

```solidity
function balanceOf(
    address account
) public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
    return _balances[account];
}
```

It takes an `address` as an input and returns the balance associated with that address from the `_balances` mapping, which is a standard way to keep track of the token balances of each address in ERC-20 tokens.

The ERC documentation does not specify the exact naming of the parameters, so the difference in parameter naming (`_owner` vs. `account`) does not constitute a violation of the standard. The functionality is what matters, and the provided function fulfills the required functionality as per the ERC-20 standard.

Therefore, the `balanceOf` function and the related parts do not violate the given ERC-20 standard.
