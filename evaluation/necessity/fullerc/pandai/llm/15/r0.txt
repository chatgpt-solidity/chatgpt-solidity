The provided Solidity event interfaces are:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
```

These events are part of the ERC-20 token standard, which is the standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC provided in your question is indeed the ERC-20 standard, which specifies the functions and events that an ERC-20 compliant token contract should implement.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the events should be declared as follows:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

The provided event interfaces match the ERC-20 standard exactly in terms of the event names, parameter types, and the use of the `indexed` keyword for the first two parameters of each event. This allows these parameters to be searchable and filterable in the blockchain logs.

Therefore, the provided Solidity event interfaces do not violate the given ERC-20 standard. They are correctly defined according to the specification.
