The provided Solidity code for the `PandAIToken` contract appears to be an implementation of an ERC20 token with some additional features, such as a custom `decimals` function and a constructor that mints an initial supply of tokens.

To determine if the function constructor and the related parts violate the given ERC (which is the ERC20 standard), we need to check if the implementation adheres to the ERC20 specification outlined in the provided ERC document.

Here are the key points from the ERC20 specification and how the provided code matches up:

1. **Token Information (Optional)**:
   - `name`: The contract has a private `_name` variable set in the constructor.
   - `symbol`: The contract has a private `_symbol` variable set in the constructor.
   - `decimals`: The `PandAIToken` contract overrides the `decimals` function to return `6` instead of the typical `18`. This is allowed as the ERC20 standard specifies that the number of decimals is optional and can be chosen by the implementing contract.

2. **Total Supply**:
   - The contract has a `_totalSupply` variable and a `totalSupply` function that returns it, which is compliant with the ERC20 standard.

3. **Balance Of**:
   - The contract has a `_balances` mapping and a `balanceOf` function that returns the balance of a given address, which is compliant with the ERC20 standard.

4. **Transfer**:
   - The ERC20 interface is not fully shown in the provided code, but it is expected that the `transfer` function is implemented as per the standard, which should return a boolean and emit a `Transfer` event.

5. **Transfer From**:
   - Similar to the `transfer` function, the `transferFrom` function is not shown, but it is expected to be implemented according to the standard, returning a boolean and emitting a `Transfer` event.

6. **Approve**:
   - The `approve` function is not shown, but it should be implemented to allow setting allowances and emit an `Approval` event.

7. **Allowance**:
   - The `allowance` function is not shown, but it should be implemented to return the remaining number of tokens that a spender is allowed to transfer on behalf of the token owner.

8. **Events**:
   - The `Transfer` and `Approval` events must be implemented as specified.

9. **Minting**:
   - The `_mint` function is an internal function that is used to create new tokens. The ERC20 standard does not specify minting functionality, but it does state that a `Transfer` event should be emitted with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created, which the provided code does.

10. **Hooks**:
    - The `_beforeTokenTransfer` and `_afterTokenTransfer` hooks are not part of the ERC20 standard, but they are internal functions and do not affect the external interface or behavior of the token as per the ERC20 standard.

From the provided code and the ERC20 specification, there does not appear to be a violation of the ERC20 standard. However, it is important to note that the full implementation of the ERC20 functions (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`) is not shown, and those would need to be compliant with the standard for the contract to be fully ERC20 compliant.

Additionally, the `PandAIToken` contract's constructor mints a large initial supply of tokens to the creator of the contract. This is not a violation of the ERC20 standard, but it is a design choice that should be made transparent to users of the token.
