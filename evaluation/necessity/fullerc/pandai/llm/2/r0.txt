The function provided in the Solidity code snippet is the `name` function, which is part of the ERC20 token standard. According to the ERC20 specification provided, the `name` function is an optional method that returns the name of the token. The ERC20 specification for the `name` function is as follows:

```solidity
function name() public view returns (string)
```

The Solidity code snippet provided for the `name` function is:

```solidity
function name() public view virtual override returns (string memory) {
    return _name;
}
```

Comparing the provided function with the ERC20 specification, we can see that the function signature matches the ERC20 standard. The function is marked as `public` and `view`, which means it does not modify the state and can be called externally. It returns a `string`, which is the expected return type for the `name` function.

The only difference is the use of `string memory` in the return type, which specifies the data location for the string being returned. In Solidity, `string` is a dynamically-sized byte array, and the `memory` keyword indicates that the string is a temporary value that will not be stored on the blockchain. This is a detail of Solidity syntax and does not violate the ERC20 standard.

Additionally, the function is marked as `virtual` and `override`. These are Solidity-specific keywords that allow for function behavior to be overridden in derived contracts. The `virtual` keyword indicates that the function can be overridden, and the `override` keyword indicates that this function is overriding a function from a base contract. These keywords do not affect the compliance with the ERC20 standard.

Therefore, the `name` function provided in the Solidity code snippet does not violate the ERC20 standard. It correctly implements an optional method as described in the ERC specification.
