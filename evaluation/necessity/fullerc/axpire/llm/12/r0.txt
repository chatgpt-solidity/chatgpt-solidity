The function `setIcoTokenExchangeRate` in the provided Solidity code is a custom function that allows the owner of the contract to set the exchange rate for the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) tokens in relation to Ether. This function is not part of the ERC-20 token standard, which is the standard described in the provided ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) document.

The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable interoperability across different applications and services, such as wallets and exchanges. The standard includes functions for transferring tokens, querying balances, and allowing tokens to be spent by approved third parties.

The provided function `setIcoTokenExchangeRate` does not directly interact with any of the ERC-20 functions such as `transfer`, `balanceOf`, `approve`, or `allowance`. It is a separate administrative function that is likely used to determine how many tokens are distributed per Ether during the ICO process.

Since the ERC-20 standard does not dictate how an ICO should be conducted or how token exchange rates should be set, the `setIcoTokenExchangeRate` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard. It is an additional feature that the contract developers have included for their specific use case.

However, it is important to note that while the function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, it must be used responsibly by the contract owner to ensure that the ICO is conducted fairly and transparently. The ability to change the exchange rate could potentially be misused if not properly managed or communicated to the participants of the ICO.

In summary, the `setIcoTokenExchangeRate` function is not part of the ERC-20 standard and does not violate it, as the standard does not cover ICO mechanisms or token exchange rate settings.
