The provided Solidity code defines a contract `AxpireToken` which inherits from `AxpirePausableToken` (not provided in the snippet) and includes a function `setHaltIco`. This function allows the owner of the contract to set a boolean variable `haltIco` which presumably is used to halt or resume an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

The ERC provided in the question appears to be a description of the ERC-20 standard, which is a common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token should implement to ensure interoperability with other contracts and clients.

The `setHaltIco` function itself does not directly interact with any of the ERC-20 functions or events. It is an administrative function that is likely used to control the behavior of the token sale process. The ERC-20 standard does not dictate how a token sale should be conducted or how administrative controls should be implemented. Therefore, the `setHaltIco` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as it does not interfere with the implementation of the standard's required functions and events.

However, if the `haltIco` variable is used in such a way that it prevents the execution of ERC-20 functions (e.g., `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, etc.) when the ICO is halted, then it could potentially violate the standard if it prevents the proper functioning of these methods. For example, if the `transfer` function checks the `haltIco` variable and disallows transfers while the ICO is halted, this would be a violation of the ERC-20 standard, which requires that transfers should always be allowed as long as the sender has sufficient balance.

Without the full context of how `haltIco` is used within the `AxpireToken` contract, it is not possible to definitively say whether it violates the ERC-20 standard. The audit should include a review of all functions that interact with the `haltIco` variable to ensure compliance with the ERC-20 standard.
