The provided Solidity code for the `sendFundHomeAmt` function and related parts of the `AxpireToken` contract do not directly interact with the ERC-20 token standard interface. Instead, the function appears to be designed to send Ether (ETH) from the contract to a predefined address (`ethFundDeposit`) that is likely associated with the token's ecosystem or the project's treasury.

The ERC-20 standard, as described in the provided ERC excerpt, specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable token transfers, approvals, and other related functionalities. The key functions include `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, and the corresponding events `Transfer` and `Approval`.

The `sendFundHomeAmt` function does not interact with any of these ERC-20 functions or events. It is a custom function that deals with the transfer of Ether, not the transfer of ERC-20 tokens. Therefore, it does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not govern how a contract should handle Ether transactions.

However, there are a few points to consider regarding the `sendFundHomeAmt` function:

1. The function uses the `send` method to transfer Ether, which is considered less safe than `transfer` or `call` with a gas stipend, as it forwards only a fixed amount of gas (2300 gas) and can fail if the receiving contract's fallback function requires more gas to execute.

2. The function multiplies the amount `_amt` by `10 ** decimals` before sending, which assumes that the amount is specified in token units and needs to be converted to wei (the smallest unit of Ether). This could be a source of confusion or error if not properly documented or understood by the users of the function.

3. The function is restricted to the contract owner by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which is a common pattern for administrative functions in contracts.

4. The `ethFundDeposit` address is marked as `private`, which means it is not visible to other contracts or external callers. It is important to ensure that this address is set correctly and securely, as it cannot be verified on-chain by external parties.

In summary, the `sendFundHomeAmt` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as it is not related to the token transfer mechanisms defined by the standard. However, it is important to handle Ether transfers securely and clearly document the intended use and behavior of custom functions like this one.
