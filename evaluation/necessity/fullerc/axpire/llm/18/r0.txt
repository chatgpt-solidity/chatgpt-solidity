The provided Solidity function interfaces are being compared to the ERC-20 token standard, which is the most common standard for Ethereum tokens. The ERC-20 standard specifies a minimal set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable interoperability across different applications and platforms.

Based on the ERC-20 standard provided in the question, let's compare the given function interfaces to the standard's requirements:

Required ERC-20 Functions:
- `function name() public view returns (string)` (Optional)
- `function symbol() public view returns (string)` (Optional)
- `function decimals() public view returns (uint8)` (Optional)
- `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
- `function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`
- `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)`

Required ERC-20 Events:
- `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
- `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

Comparing the provided interfaces to the ERC-20 standard:

- The `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` functions are optional and are correctly implemented as view functions returning the appropriate types.
- The `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance` functions are implemented and match the ERC-20 standard.
- The `burn` and `burnFrom` functions are not part of the ERC-20 standard but are common extensions for token contracts that allow tokens to be "burned" or permanently removed from circulation.
- The `transferOwnership`, `pause`, `unpause`, and other administrative functions are not part of the ERC-20 standard. These functions are typically part of a token's administrative or governance mechanisms and do not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as they do not interfere with the standard's required functions.
- The `constructor`, `createTokens`, `setIcoTokenExchangeRate`, `setHaltIco`, `sendFundHome`, `sendFundHomeAmt`, `toggleDead`, `endIco`, `tokenCreationCap`, `paused`, `tokenSaleActive`, `icoTokenExchangeRate`, `owner`, `haltIco`, and `dead` functions are not part of the ERC-20 standard. These functions seem to be related to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or other token management mechanisms and do not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as they do not interfere with the standard's required functions.

The provided function interfaces do not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the required functions and events are correctly implemented and the additional functions do not interfere with the standard's operations. However, it is important to note that the actual implementation of these functions and the firing of the required events (`Transfer` and `Approval`) must be done according to the standard for the contract to be fully ERC-20 compliant.
