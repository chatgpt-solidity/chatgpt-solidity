The provided Solidity code for the `burn` function and related parts of the smart contract do not appear to violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard primarily specifies the functions and events related to the transfer of tokens, including `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, as well as the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.

The `burn` function in the provided code is an additional feature that is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It allows token holders to destroy (or "burn") a certain amount of tokens they own, effectively reducing the total supply of tokens. This is a common feature in many token contracts, as it can be used for various purposes, such as deflationary mechanisms or redeeming tokens for other assets.

The `burn` function in the provided code correctly:

1. Checks that the amount to be burned is greater than 0.
2. Checks that the burner has enough tokens to burn.
3. Reduces the burner's balance by the amount to be burned using `SafeMath.sub` to prevent underflow.
4. Reduces the `totalSupply` by the amount to be burned.
5. Emits a `Transfer` event with the `to` address set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which is in line with the ERC-20 standard's requirement that a `Transfer` event should be triggered when tokens are transferred, including when tokens are created or destroyed.
6. Emits a custom `Burn` event, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard but does not conflict with it.

It is important to note that while the `burn` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, it is an additional feature that is not required by the standard. Any additional functions or features should be clearly documented and communicated to users of the token, as they may not be supported by all wallets or interfaces that expect strict adherence to the ERC-20 standard.

In summary, the `burn` function and related parts of the smart contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard, but they do add functionality beyond what the standard requires.
