The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and related parts of the smart contract are intended to implement an ERC20 token with additional functionality, specifically a pausable feature. The ERC20 standard is a widely-adopted token standard in the Ethereum ecosystem, which outlines a set of rules and functions that an ERC20 token must implement.

Let's analyze the provided code against the ERC20 standard:

1. The `transfer` function in `StandardToken` contract checks if the sender has enough balance and if the value to be transferred is greater than 0, then it performs the transfer and emits a `Transfer` event. This is in line with the ERC20 standard, which requires that the `transfer` function should throw (revert) if the sender does not have enough balance. However, the ERC20 standard does not specify the behavior for transfers of value 0; it only states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event, which the provided code does.

2. The `AxpirePausableToken` contract inherits from `StandardToken` and overrides the `transfer` function to add the `whenNotPaused` modifier. This means that the `transfer` function can only be called when the contract is not paused. This is an additional feature on top of the standard ERC20 functionality and is not a violation of the ERC20 standard. The ERC20 standard does not prohibit adding additional features or modifiers to the functions as long as the basic requirements are met.

3. The `Pausable` contract introduces a mechanism to pause and unpause the contract, which is a common pattern for emergency stop functionality in smart contracts. This does not conflict with the ERC20 standard, as it is an additional feature for contract management and does not affect the compliance of the `transfer` function with the standard.

In conclusion, the provided `transfer` function and related parts of the smart contract do not violate the ERC20 standard. The contract correctly implements the required functionality for the `transfer` method as specified by the ERC20 standard, and the additional pausable feature does not conflict with the standard's requirements. However, it is important to note that the pausable feature is an extension and not part of the ERC20 standard itself, so users and integrators of the token should be aware of this additional behavior.
