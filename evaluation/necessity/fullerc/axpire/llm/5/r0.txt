The provided Solidity code defines a contract `Ownable` that includes a function `transferOwnership` which allows the current owner of the contract to transfer ownership to a new address. This is a common pattern used in many smart contracts to ensure that there is a clear and secure way to transfer control of the contract when necessary.

The ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) provided appears to be describing the ERC-20 standard, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a token contract should implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These functions and events relate to the transfer of tokens, querying token balances, and allowing tokens to be approved for spending by third parties.

The `transferOwnership` function and the `Ownable` contract are not part of the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-20 standard focuses on token-related functionality and does not dictate how the ownership of the token contract itself should be managed. Therefore, the `transferOwnership` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it is not related to the token functionality that the standard defines.

In summary, the `transferOwnership` function is a separate concern from the ERC-20 token standard. It is a part of contract access control and does not interfere with or contradict the ERC-20 specifications. As long as the token-related functions and events specified by ERC-20 are correctly implemented, the contract can include additional features like ownership management without violating the standard.
