The `approveAndCall` function in the provided Solidity code is not part of the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement, and `approveAndCall` is not one of them.

However, the `approveAndCall` function is a common extension to the ERC-20 standard that some contracts implement to allow for more complex interactions with contracts that accept ERC-20 tokens. The idea is to approve a certain amount of tokens for a spender and then immediately call a function on the spender's contract in a single transaction.

The ERC-20 standard functions that are relevant to the `approveAndCall` function are `approve` and `allowance`. The `approve` function allows a spender to withdraw up to a certain amount of tokens from the owner's account, and the `allowance` function returns the amount still available for the spender.

The `approveAndCall` function in the provided code does the following:

1. Sets the allowance for `_spender` to `_value` by updating the `allowed` mapping.
2. Emits the `Approval` event, which is required by the ERC-20 standard whenever the `approve` function is successfully called.
3. Attempts to call the `receiveApproval` function on the `_spender` contract with the provided `_extraData`.

The code has a few issues:

- The `Approval` event should be emitted with the `emit` keyword (as per Solidity 0.4.21 and later), but this is a minor issue and depends on the Solidity version used.
- The use of `throw` is deprecated in favor of `revert()`, `require()`, and `assert()` for error handling in newer versions of Solidity.
- The `approveAndCall` function does not check if the `_spender` is a contract, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `_spender` is an externally owned account (EOA).
- The `approveAndCall` function does not follow the ERC-20 standard's recommendation to set the allowance to zero before setting it to a new value. This is a known potential security issue related to race conditions, but as the ERC states, the contract itself shouldn't enforce it to allow backward compatibility.

In conclusion, the `approveAndCall` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it is an extension rather than a modification of the standard functions. However, the implementation could be improved by addressing the issues mentioned above, and it is important to note that any extensions to the ERC-20 standard should be clearly documented and used with caution to avoid unexpected behavior.
