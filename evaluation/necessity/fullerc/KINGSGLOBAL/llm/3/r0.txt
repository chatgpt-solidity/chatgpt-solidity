The provided Solidity function `approve` from the `StandardToken` contract is intended to comply with the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 standard specifies the `approve` function as follows:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
```

The `approve` function allows `_spender` to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

The provided `approve` function in the `StandardToken` contract is:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This function sets the allowance in the `allowed` mapping and emits an `Approval` event, which is in line with the ERC20 standard. However, there are a few issues with this implementation that do not align with best practices or the ERC20 standard:

1. The function signature does not include the `public` visibility specifier. In Solidity, functions are `public` by default, but it is a best practice to explicitly state the visibility for clarity.

2. The `Approval` event should be declared in the contract, and it should use the `emit` keyword when emitting the event, which is a best practice since Solidity 0.4.21. The event declaration and emission should look like this:

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);

function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

3. The ERC20 standard mentions a known issue with the `approve` function related to the potential for a race condition. It suggests that clients should set the allowance to 0 before setting it to a new value for the same spender. While the contract itself should not enforce this to maintain backward compatibility, it is important to note this in the documentation or comments.

4. The function does not have a return type specified. In Solidity, the return type should be explicitly stated, even though the function returns a value. The correct signature should include `returns (bool success)`.

5. The function does not check for the success of the `Approval` event emission. While this is not strictly required by the ERC20 standard, it is a good practice to ensure that events are successfully emitted.

In conclusion, the provided `approve` function does not fully adhere to the ERC20 standard and best practices due to missing visibility specifiers, the absence of the `emit` keyword, and lack of documentation regarding the known race condition issue. However, the core functionality of setting the allowance and emitting an event is present, which means it does not fundamentally violate the ERC20 standard. It is recommended to update the function to align with the best practices and the latest Solidity syntax.
