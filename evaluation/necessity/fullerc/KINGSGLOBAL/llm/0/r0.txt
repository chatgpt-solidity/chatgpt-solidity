The provided Solidity function `transfer` is intended to be part of an ERC20 token contract, as it is a common method within the ERC20 standard. To determine if the function complies with the ERC20 standard, we need to compare it with the ERC20 specification provided.

Here is the relevant part of the ERC20 specification for the `transfer` function:

```
transfer
Transfers _value amount of tokens to address _to, and MUST fire the Transfer event. The function SHOULD throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend. 
Note Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event.
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```

Now, let's analyze the provided `transfer` function:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] >= _value && _value > 0) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Comparing the provided function with the ERC20 specification, we can identify the following issues:

1. **Throwing on Failure**: The ERC20 standard states that the function SHOULD throw if the sender does not have enough balance. In the provided function, instead of throwing an error, it returns `false`. This is a deviation from the standard's recommendation. The use of `require` would be more appropriate to throw an error when the sender's balance is insufficient.

2. **Transfer of 0 Values**: The ERC20 standard specifies that transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event. The provided function has a condition `_value > 0` which means it will not proceed with the transfer or fire the Transfer event if `_value` is 0. This is a violation of the ERC20 standard.

3. **Visibility and Mutability**: The provided function does not specify the visibility (e.g., `public`) and mutability (e.g., `view`, `pure`, `payable`). According to the ERC20 standard and best practices, the function should be marked as `public`.

4. **Event Emission**: The ERC20 standard requires that the `Transfer` event must be fired when tokens are transferred. The provided function does emit the `Transfer` event, which is correct. However, it should also emit the event for 0 value transfers, which it currently does not.

5. **Return Value**: The ERC20 standard requires the function to return a boolean value indicating success. The provided function does this correctly.

To summarize, the provided `transfer` function violates the ERC20 standard in the following ways:

- It does not throw an error when the sender's balance is insufficient.
- It does not allow for transfers of 0 value and does not emit the `Transfer` event for such transfers.
- It lacks the `public` visibility specifier.

Here is a revised version of the function that would be compliant with the ERC20 standard:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This revised function uses `require` to ensure that the sender has enough balance, allows for 0 value transfers, and is marked as `public`. It also uses the `emit` keyword for event emission, which is a best practice in newer Solidity versions.
