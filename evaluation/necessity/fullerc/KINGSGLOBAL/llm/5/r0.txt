The provided Solidity code for the `totalSupply` function in the `Token` contract does not fully comply with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the given ERC documentation. Here are the issues with the provided function:

1. **Visibility Modifier**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `totalSupply` function should be `public` and `view`. The provided function does not have any visibility modifier, which by default makes it `public`, but it is missing the `view` modifier. The `view` modifier indicates that the function does not modify the state and allows the function to be called externally and to return a value without any transaction cost (gas).

2. **Constant vs View**: The `constant` keyword used in the provided function is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity (0.4.17 and above). The `view` keyword should be used instead to indicate that the function does not alter the state.

3. **Return Variable Name**: The ERC-20 standard does not require the return variable to have a name. While this is not a violation of the standard, it is unnecessary and can be omitted for simplicity.

4. **Documentation Comment**: The ERC-20 standard does not require a specific comment style. However, it is good practice to provide clear NatSpec comments that describe the function's behavior according to the standard.

Here is a revised version of the `totalSupply` function that would comply with the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.17; // or a more recent version

contract Token {
    uint256 private _totalSupply;

    /// @notice Get the total token supply
    /// @return The total supply of tokens
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
        return _totalSupply;
    }

    // Other ERC-20 functions and events would be here
}
```

In this revised version, the function is marked as `public` and `view`, and the return variable name is omitted. Additionally, a state variable `_totalSupply` is introduced to hold the total supply value, and a NatSpec comment is added for better clarity.

Please note that the actual implementation of the `totalSupply` function would need to correctly interact with the state variable that tracks the total supply of tokens, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.
