The provided Solidity event interfaces:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
```

These events match the ERC-20 token standard's event specifications:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `Transfer` event must trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers, and the `Approval` event must trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

The provided event interfaces have the correct number of arguments and the correct types (`address` and `uint256`), and they use the `indexed` keyword for the addresses, which is necessary for filtering events by these parameters.

Therefore, the provided event interfaces do not violate the ERC-20 standard. They are in compliance with the event specifications of the ERC-20 token standard.
