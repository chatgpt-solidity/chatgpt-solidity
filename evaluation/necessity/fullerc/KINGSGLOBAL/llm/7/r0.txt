The provided Solidity code for the `KINGSGLOBAL` contract includes a fallback function that is triggered when the contract receives Ether (ETH) directly without any data (i.e., when someone sends ETH to the contract address). The fallback function is designed to handle incoming ETH, convert it to an equivalent amount of the contract's tokens based on a predefined rate (`unitsOneEthCanBuy`), and then transfer the tokens to the sender's address.

The ERC-20 standard, as described in the provided ERC excerpt, specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract should implement. The key functions include `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, and the key events include `Transfer` and `Approval`.

The `KINGSGLOBAL` contract's fallback function does not directly violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not explicitly define how a contract should behave when receiving ETH. However, there are several issues and considerations that should be addressed:

1. **Transfer Event**: The ERC-20 standard requires that a `Transfer` event is fired whenever tokens are transferred. In the provided code, the `Transfer` event is called, but it does not follow the ERC-20 standard's requirement of using the `event` keyword to declare the event. It should be declared as `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);` and then emitted using `emit Transfer(fundsWallet, msg.sender, amount);`.

2. **Security Considerations**: The fallback function transfers ETH to `fundsWallet` after updating token balances. This could potentially be a security risk if the `fundsWallet` is a contract with a fallback function that could fail or be exploited, causing the entire transaction to revert and potentially enabling denial-of-service attacks.

3. **Reentrancy Risk**: The fallback function does not seem to protect against reentrancy attacks. It should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy by making state changes before calling external contracts (i.e., transferring ETH).

4. **Compliance with ERC-20**: While the fallback function itself does not violate ERC-20, it is important to ensure that the rest of the `KINGSGLOBAL` contract implements all the required functions and events as per the ERC-20 standard. This includes `approve`, `allowance`, `transferFrom`, and the correct behavior of `transfer`.

5. **Gas Limit**: Fallback functions should be designed to use a minimal amount of gas since the gas stipend for fallback functions is limited (2300 gas when sent via `.send()` or `.transfer()`). The operations in the provided fallback function may exceed this limit, especially if the `fundsWallet.transfer(msg.value);` call interacts with a contract.

6. **Function Visibility**: The fallback function should be marked as `external` to indicate that it can only be called from outside the contract.

7. **Return Values**: The ERC-20 standard mentions that functions should return a boolean value to indicate success or failure. The fallback function does not return any value, but this is acceptable since it is not one of the functions defined in the ERC-20 standard.

In conclusion, while the fallback function does not directly violate the ERC-20 standard, it has several issues that need to be addressed to ensure security, proper event emission, and overall compliance with best practices and the ERC-20 standard. It is also essential to review the entire `KINGSGLOBAL` contract to ensure full ERC-20 compliance.
