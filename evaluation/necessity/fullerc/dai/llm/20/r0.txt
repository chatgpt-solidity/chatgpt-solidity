The provided Solidity function interfaces appear to be for a token contract. To determine if it violates the given ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment), we need to compare the provided interfaces with the standard methods and events defined in the ERC.

The ERC in question is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the provided specification, it seems to be describing the ERC-20 standard, which is a common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

Let's compare the provided interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

Required ERC-20 Methods:
- `totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
- `balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`
- `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)`

Optional ERC-20 Methods:
- `name() public view returns (string)`
- `symbol() public view returns (string)`
- `decimals() public view returns (uint8)`

Required ERC-20 Events:
- `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
- `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

Comparing the provided interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

- The `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `allowance`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` methods match the ERC-20 standard.
- The `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` methods are optional in ERC-20, but the provided interfaces return `bytes32` for `name` and `symbol`, and `uint256` for `decimals`, instead of `string` and `uint8` as specified in the ERC-20 standard. This is a deviation from the standard.
- The `approve(address) returns(bool)` method is not part of the ERC-20 standard and seems to be an overloaded version of the `approve` method without the `_value` parameter.
- The `DSToken(bytes32) returns()`, `push`, `pull`, `move`, `mint`, `burn`, `setName`, `stopped`, `owner`, `setOwner`, `setAuthority`, `authority`, `start`, and `stop` methods are not part of the ERC-20 standard.
- The provided interfaces do not include the `Transfer` and `Approval` events, which are required by the ERC-20 standard.

Based on the comparison, the provided interfaces do not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard due to the following reasons:

1. The `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` methods have incorrect return types.
2. There is an overloaded `approve` method that does not match the standard.
3. There are additional non-standard methods that are not part of ERC-20.
4. The required `Transfer` and `Approval` events are missing.

To be compliant with the ERC-20 standard, the contract would need to adjust the return types for `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`, remove or modify non-standard methods, and include the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.
