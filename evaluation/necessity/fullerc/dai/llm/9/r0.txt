The provided Solidity code for the `approve` function and related parts of the smart contract seem to be compliant with the ERC-20 token standard, with one exception that needs to be addressed.

The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `approve` function should allow a spender to withdraw from the owner's account multiple times, up to the value amount. If the function is called again, it should overwrite the current allowance with the new value. The standard also notes that to prevent certain attack vectors, clients should set the allowance to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender, but the contract itself should not enforce this to allow backward compatibility.

The `DSTokenBase` contract's `approve` function correctly sets the allowance in the `_approvals` mapping and emits the `Approval` event, which is compliant with the ERC-20 standard.

However, there is a potential issue with the `DSToken` contract's `approve` function. The `DSToken` contract inherits from `DSStop`, which introduces a `stoppable` modifier. This modifier requires that the `stopped` boolean is false for the function to execute. If the contract is stopped (i.e., `stopped` is true), the `approve` function will revert due to the `require(!stopped)` statement in the `stoppable` modifier.

This behavior is not directly addressed in the ERC-20 standard. While the standard does not forbid the use of additional modifiers or control mechanisms, it does specify that callers must handle false returns from `approve` and must not assume that false is never returned. The `stoppable` modifier does not return false; it reverts the transaction if the contract is stopped. This could be seen as a deviation from the standard's guidance on handling failure cases.

To ensure full compliance with the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should ideally return false instead of reverting when the contract is stopped. This would allow callers to handle the failure case as specified by the standard.

In summary, the `approve` function itself is compliant with the ERC-20 standard, but the use of the `stoppable` modifier introduces behavior that could be seen as a deviation from the standard's guidance on handling failure cases. It is recommended to adjust the implementation to return false instead of reverting when the contract is stopped, to fully align with the ERC-20 standard's expectations for failure handling.
