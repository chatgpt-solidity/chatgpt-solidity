The provided Solidity function `allowance` within the `DSTokenBase` contract appears to be compliant with the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies the `allowance` function as follows:

```solidity
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
```

The purpose of the `allowance` function is to return the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`. This is typically used in conjunction with the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions to enable delegated token transfers.

The `allowance` function in the `DSTokenBase` contract is implemented as follows:

```solidity
function allowance(address src, address guy) public view returns (uint) {
    return _approvals[src][guy];
}
```

This implementation meets the ERC-20 standard's requirements for the `allowance` function:

1. It is a public function.
2. It is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state and should return the same result every time for the same input.
3. It returns the remaining amount of tokens that `guy` (the spender) is allowed to transfer from `src` (the owner).

The only minor difference is the naming of the parameters (`src` and `guy` instead of `_owner` and `_spender`), but this does not affect the compliance with the standard as the functionality remains the same.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the `allowance` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard. However, it is important to note that a full audit would require reviewing the entire contract, including how the `_approvals` mapping is managed, how the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions are implemented, and whether all required events are properly emitted.
