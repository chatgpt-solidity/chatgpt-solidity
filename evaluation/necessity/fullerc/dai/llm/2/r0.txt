The provided Solidity code defines a contract `DSAuth` with a function `setOwner` that allows changing the owner of the contract. The code also includes an authorization mechanism that restricts the execution of certain functions to the owner or an authorized authority.

The provided ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) appears to be describing the ERC-20 standard, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a token contract should implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These functions include `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`, along with the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.

The `setOwner` function and the related parts of the `DSAuth` contract do not directly relate to the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-20 standard does not specify ownership or authorization mechanisms for token contracts; it focuses solely on the token-related functionalities. The `setOwner` function is part of the contract's access control mechanism, which is outside the scope of the ERC-20 standard.

Therefore, the `setOwner` function and the related parts do not violate the ERC-20 standard because they do not pertain to the token functionalities that the standard defines. It is common for token contracts to have additional administrative functions and access controls that are not covered by the ERC-20 standard. These are typically used for contract management and are separate from the token interface itself.

However, it is important to note that any additional functions, such as `setOwner`, should be designed and implemented with care to ensure the security and integrity of the contract. Access control mechanisms should be thoroughly audited to prevent unauthorized access and potential security vulnerabilities.
