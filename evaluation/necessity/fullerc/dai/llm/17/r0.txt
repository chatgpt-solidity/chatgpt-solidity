The provided Solidity code for the `mint` function and related parts of the smart contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. The ERC-20 standard does not define a `mint` function. The `mint` function is an additional feature that some token contracts implement to create new tokens. The ERC-20 standard only requires the implementation of the functions and events listed in the specification.

2. The `mint` function in the provided code correctly updates the balance of the recipient (`guy`) and the total supply (`_supply`). It also emits a `Mint` event, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard. However, the ERC-20 standard does require a `Transfer` event to be emitted when tokens are transferred, including when new tokens are created (with the `_from` address set to `0x0`). The provided code should emit a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address as `0x0` to comply with this requirement.

3. The `mint` function is protected by the `auth` modifier, which restricts the function to be called only by an authorized address (typically the contract owner or another authorized entity). This is a common practice for administrative functions like minting.

4. The `mint` function is also protected by the `stoppable` modifier, which prevents the function from being called if the `stopped` variable is set to `true`. This is a circuit breaker pattern that allows the contract to be paused in case of an emergency.

5. The `DSMath` contract's `add` function is used to safely add two `uint` values together, protecting against overflow. This is a good practice and is in line with the ERC-20 standard's recommendation to prevent arithmetic overflows.

6. The `DSTokenBase` contract inherits from `ERC20`, which is not explicitly shown in the provided code. It is assumed that the `ERC20` contract implements the standard ERC-20 functions and events.

In summary, the provided `mint` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it should be modified to emit the `Transfer` event with the `_from` address as `0x0` when new tokens are created to fully comply with the standard. Additionally, the rest of the ERC-20 required functions and events must be implemented in the `ERC20` contract that `DSTokenBase` inherits from, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.
