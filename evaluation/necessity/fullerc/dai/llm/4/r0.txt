The provided Solidity code for the `totalSupply` function appears to be compliant with the ERC20 standard as described in the given ERC documentation. The ERC20 standard specifies that the `totalSupply` function should return the total token supply, and the code provided does exactly that:

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint) {
    return _supply;
}
```

This function is marked as `public` and `view`, meaning it can be called by anyone and does not modify the state of the blockchain. It returns an unsigned integer (`uint`), which is the total supply of the tokens. The ERC20 standard specifies that the return type should be `uint256`, but in Solidity, `uint` is an alias for `uint256`, so this is also compliant.

The ERC20 standard does not specify the internal implementation details or state variables of the contract, such as the `_supply` variable in this case. It only requires that the `totalSupply` function returns the total supply of tokens. Therefore, as long as the `_supply` variable accurately represents the total supply of tokens in the contract, the implementation is compliant with the ERC20 standard.

In conclusion, based on the provided code snippet and the ERC20 standard documentation, the `totalSupply` function does not violate the ERC20 standard. However, to fully ensure compliance, one would need to review the entire contract, including how `_supply` is managed throughout the contract's functions, to ensure that it accurately reflects the total supply of tokens at all times.
