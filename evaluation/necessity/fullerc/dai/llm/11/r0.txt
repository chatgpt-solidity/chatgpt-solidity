The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code does not fully comply with the ERC-20 token standard for the following reasons:

1. The `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract sets the allowance to `uint(-1)` (i.e., the maximum value for a `uint256`), regardless of the value passed by the caller. This behavior deviates from the ERC-20 standard, which states that the `approve` function should allow a spender to withdraw up to the `_value` amount. It should not automatically set the allowance to the maximum possible value.

2. The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `approve` function should emit an `Approval` event upon a successful call. However, the `DSToken` contract's `approve` function does not emit an `Approval` event directly; it relies on the `DSTokenBase` contract's `approve` function to emit the event. While this might be acceptable if the `DSTokenBase` contract's `approve` function is called with the correct parameters, the `DSToken` contract's `approve` function does not pass the `_value` parameter to the base contract's `approve` function, which means the `Approval` event will not reflect the correct allowance value.

3. The ERC-20 standard also mentions that clients should ensure that the allowance is set to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender to prevent certain attack vectors. The provided code does not enforce this, which is correct according to the standard. However, it is worth noting that the standard recommends client interfaces handle this behavior, not the contract itself.

4. The `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract is marked with the `stoppable` modifier from the `DSStop` contract. This modifier introduces additional functionality that is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It allows the contract owner to stop all token transfers if the `stopped` variable is set to `true`. While this does not directly violate the ERC-20 standard, it adds behavior that token holders should be aware of, as it can prevent the `approve` function from being called when the contract is stopped.

In summary, the `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract does not comply with the ERC-20 standard because it sets the allowance to the maximum value instead of the value specified by the caller and does not emit an `Approval` event with the correct allowance value. Additionally, the `stoppable` modifier introduces non-standard behavior that could affect the function's availability.
