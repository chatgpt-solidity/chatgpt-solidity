The provided Solidity function interfaces are being compared to the ERC-20 token standard, which is the most common standard for Ethereum tokens. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement.

Here's a comparison of the provided interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

ERC-20 Required Functions:
- `function name() public view returns (string)` (Optional)
- `function symbol() public view returns (string)` (Optional)
- `function decimals() public view returns (uint8)` (Optional)
- `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
- `function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`
- `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)`

ERC-20 Required Events:
- `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
- `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

Provided Function Interfaces:
- `mint(address,uint256) returns(bool)` (Not part of ERC-20, related to token creation)
- `finishMinting() returns(bool)` (Not part of ERC-20, related to ending the minting process)
- `transferOwnership(address) returns()` (Not part of ERC-20, related to ownership management)
- `transferFrom(address,address,uint256) returns()` (Part of ERC-20 but should return `bool`)
- `approve(address,uint256) returns()` (Part of ERC-20 but should return `bool`)
- `allowance(address,address) returns(uint256)` (Part of ERC-20)
- `transfer(address,uint256) returns()` (Part of ERC-20 but should return `bool`)
- `balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)` (Part of ERC-20)
- `pause() returns(bool)` (Not part of ERC-20, related to pausing the contract)
- `unpause() returns(bool)` (Not part of ERC-20, related to unpausing the contract)
- `mintTimelocked(address,uint256,uint256) returns(TokenTimelock)` (Not part of ERC-20, related to time-locked tokens)
- `name() returns(string)` (Part of ERC-20, optional)
- `paused() returns(bool)` (Not part of ERC-20, related to checking if the contract is paused)
- `symbol() returns(string)` (Part of ERC-20, optional)
- `decimals() returns(uint256)` (Part of ERC-20, optional but should return `uint8`)
- `mintingFinished() returns(bool)` (Not part of ERC-20, related to minting status)
- `owner() returns(address)` (Not part of ERC-20, related to ownership management)
- `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` (Part of ERC-20)

The provided function interfaces violate the ERC-20 standard in the following ways:
1. The `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions should return a `bool` to indicate success, but in the provided interfaces, they do not return any value.
2. The `decimals` function should return `uint8` instead of `uint256`.
3. The provided interfaces include additional functions that are not part of the ERC-20 standard, such as `mint`, `finishMinting`, `transferOwnership`, `pause`, `unpause`, `mintTimelocked`, `paused`, `mintingFinished`, and `owner`. These functions are not required by ERC-20 and are typically part of a more complex token contract that may have additional features beyond the standard.

Additionally, the provided interfaces do not include the required `Transfer` and `Approval` events, which are essential for ERC-20 compliance.

In conclusion, the provided Solidity function interfaces do not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard due to missing return types for some functions, incorrect return type for `decimals`, and additional non-standard functions and missing events.
