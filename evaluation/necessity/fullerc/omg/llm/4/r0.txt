The provided Solidity function `approve` in the `StandardToken` contract is intended to comply with the ERC20 token standard. However, there is a specific part of the function that does not align with the current ERC20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation.

The issue lies in the following line of the `approve` function:

```solidity
if ((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)) throw;
```

This line enforces that the token owner must set the allowance to zero before setting it to a new value if the current allowance is not already zero. This was a suggested mitigation for the known ERC20 race condition issue, where a spender could potentially spend an allowance twice.

However, the ERC20 standard explicitly states:

> NOTE: To prevent attack vectors like the one described here and discussed here, clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before.

This means that while it is recommended for clients (user interfaces) to set the allowance to zero before setting a new value, the contract itself should not enforce this behavior to maintain backward compatibility with contracts deployed before this mitigation was suggested.

The `approve` function in the `StandardToken` contract violates this aspect of the ERC20 standard by enforcing the zero allowance requirement within the contract logic itself, which is not recommended by the standard.

Additionally, the `approve` function should return a boolean value to indicate success or failure, as per the ERC20 standard:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
```

The provided `approve` function does not have a return type, and it uses the `throw` statement for error handling, which is an outdated pattern in Solidity. The `throw` statement has been deprecated in favor of `require`, `revert`, or `assert` functions, which provide more gas-efficient error handling.

To comply with the ERC20 standard, the `approve` function should be updated to use a modern error handling pattern and return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation. Here is an example of a compliant `approve` function:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    // Note: Clients are responsible for setting the allowance to zero before updating it.
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

In this updated function, the `emit` keyword is used to trigger the `Approval` event, which is the current best practice in Solidity, and the function returns `true` to indicate success. The enforcement of setting the allowance to zero is removed, adhering to the ERC20 standard's recommendation.
