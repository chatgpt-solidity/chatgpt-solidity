To determine whether the `transferFrom` function and related parts of the provided Solidity code violate the given ERC (which appears to be ERC-20 based on the description and methods), we need to compare the implementation against the ERC-20 standard's requirements for the `transferFrom` method.

The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `transferFrom` function should:

1. Transfer `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`.
2. Fire the `Transfer` event.
3. Throw an error unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
4. Return a boolean value indicating success.

Let's examine the provided `transferFrom` function:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint _value
) onlyPayloadSize(3 * 32) {
    var _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];

    // Check is not needed because sub(_allowance, _value) will already throw if this condition is not met
    // if (_value > _allowance) throw;

    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    balances[_from] = balances[_from].sub(_value);
    allowed[_from][msg.sender] = _allowance.sub(_value);
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
}
```

The function checks the allowance for the `msg.sender` to spend tokens on behalf of `_from` and then updates the balances and allowance accordingly. It also fires the `Transfer` event as required by the ERC-20 standard.

However, there are a few issues with the provided code:

1. The function does not return a boolean value indicating success or failure, which is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard. This can lead to compatibility issues with other contracts that expect a boolean return value.

2. The `onlyPayloadSize` modifier is used to prevent the short address attack by checking the payload size. However, this is not a requirement of the ERC-20 standard and can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is called with additional data.

3. The use of `throw` is outdated and should be replaced with `require` statements for better gas efficiency and clearer error handling. The `throw` keyword has been deprecated in favor of `revert()`, `require()`, and `assert()`.

4. The `SafeMath` library is used for safe arithmetic operations, which is good practice to prevent overflows and underflows. However, the `assert` function within `SafeMath` should not throw; instead, it should use `revert()` for failed assertions.

5. The `Transfer` event should be emitted with the correct capitalization as `event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`. In Solidity, event names are case-sensitive, and the provided code uses `Transfer` instead of `transfer`, which could lead to issues with event watchers expecting the correct case.

To comply with the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should be modified to return a boolean value, use up-to-date error handling with `require` or `revert`, and ensure that the `Transfer` event is emitted with the correct capitalization. Additionally, the `onlyPayloadSize` modifier should be carefully considered, as it is not part of the ERC-20 specification and may not be necessary with modern Solidity compilers that have mitigations for the short address attack.
