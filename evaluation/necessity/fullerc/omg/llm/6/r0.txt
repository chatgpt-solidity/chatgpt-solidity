The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and related parts of the `BasicToken` contract is intended to implement an ERC20 token, as indicated by the inheritance from `ERC20Basic`. Let's analyze the code against the ERC20 standard as described in the provided ERC specification:

1. **Return Value**: The ERC20 standard specifies that the `transfer` function should return a boolean value indicating success or failure. However, the provided `transfer` function does not return any value. This is a violation of the ERC20 standard.

2. **Transfer Event**: The ERC20 standard requires that a `Transfer` event is fired when tokens are transferred. The provided code correctly fires the `Transfer` event, which is compliant with the standard.

3. **Checking Balances**: The ERC20 standard states that the function should throw if the sender does not have enough balance to transfer. The provided code uses the `SafeMath` library to subtract the balance, which will throw an error if the sender does not have enough tokens due to the use of `assert` in the `sub` function. This is compliant with the standard.

4. **Short Address Attack Mitigation**: The provided code includes a modifier `onlyPayloadSize` to mitigate the short address attack. This is not part of the ERC20 standard, but it is a security enhancement and does not violate the standard.

5. **Zero Value Transfers**: The ERC20 standard states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event. The provided code does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0, but since it does not prevent it and the `Transfer` event is fired, it is compliant with the standard.

6. **SafeMath Library**: The `SafeMath` library is used for safe mathematical operations to prevent overflows and underflows. This is a common practice and does not violate the ERC20 standard.

To make the `BasicToken` contract compliant with the ERC20 standard, the `transfer` function should be modified to return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer. Here is a revised version of the `transfer` function:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) returns (bool success) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

In this revised version, the function now includes a `require` statement to check the sender's balance (which is a more common practice than using `assert` in the `SafeMath` library), and it returns `true` to indicate success. The `throw` statement has been replaced with `require` to provide a revert reason, and the `Transfer` event is now correctly prefixed with `emit` as per the newer Solidity syntax.

Please note that the provided code uses an older version of Solidity (e.g., `throw` is used instead of `revert` or `require`), and the actual ERC20 standard has evolved since then. It is recommended to use the latest Solidity practices and consider the most up-to-date ERC20 implementations, such as those provided by OpenZeppelin.
