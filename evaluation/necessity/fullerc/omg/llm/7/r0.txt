The `balanceOf` function provided in the `BasicToken` contract appears to be compliant with the ERC20 standard as described in the ERC excerpt you provided. The ERC20 standard specifies that the `balanceOf` function should:

- Accept an address `_owner` as a parameter.
- Return the account balance of the specified address as a `uint256`.

The `balanceOf` function in the `BasicToken` contract does exactly that:

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
}
```

However, there are a couple of minor discrepancies that should be noted:

1. The `constant` keyword is used in the `balanceOf` function, which is an older Solidity convention. In more recent versions of Solidity (0.4.17 and above, as mentioned in the ERC), the `view` or `pure` keyword should be used instead to indicate that the function does not modify the state. The `constant` keyword has been deprecated in favor of `view` and `pure` in later Solidity versions.

2. The return type in the ERC20 standard is specified as `uint256`, while in the provided `balanceOf` function, it is simply `uint`. In Solidity, `uint` is an alias for `uint256`, so this is not a violation of the standard, but it is a slight deviation from the exact wording in the ERC20 specification.

3. The ERC20 standard specifies that the `balanceOf` function should be marked as `public` and `view`. The provided function does not explicitly specify the visibility, which defaults to `public` in Solidity, but it should be explicitly marked as `public` for clarity and to match the standard's specification. Additionally, it should be marked as `view` to indicate that it does not modify the state.

To fully comply with the ERC20 standard and modern Solidity conventions, the `balanceOf` function should be updated as follows:

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
}
```

Other than these minor issues, the `balanceOf` function does not violate the ERC20 standard as it correctly returns the balance of the specified address.
