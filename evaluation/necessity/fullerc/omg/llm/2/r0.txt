The function `transferOwnership` and the related parts provided in the Solidity code are part of a contract that appears to be implementing an ownership management system, typically used to control who has administrative control over a contract. This is a common pattern in smart contracts and is not directly related to the ERC-20 token standard.

The ERC-20 standard, as described in the provided ERC text, specifies a standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of methods and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable interoperability with other contracts, wallets, and clients. The methods include `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`, along with the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.

The `transferOwnership` function is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is a separate functionality that is often included in contracts to allow the owner to transfer control of the contract to another address. This function is typically found in the `Ownable` contract pattern, which is used to restrict certain actions (like changing critical contract parameters) to the owner of the contract.

Since the `transferOwnership` function is not specified in the ERC-20 standard, it does not violate the standard. It is an additional feature that contract developers may include for administrative purposes. However, it is important to note that the `transferOwnership` function should be used with caution, as transferring ownership of a token contract can have significant implications.

In summary, the `transferOwnership` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it is not part of the ERC-20 token functionality. It is a separate concern related to contract administration and access control.
