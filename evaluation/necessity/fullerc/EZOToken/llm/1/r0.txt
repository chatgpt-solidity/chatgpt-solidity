The provided Solidity code defines two contracts: `Ownable` and `Haltable`. The `Ownable` contract establishes an `owner` address and a modifier `onlyOwner` that restricts certain functions to be called only by the owner. The `Haltable` contract inherits from `Ownable` and introduces a mechanism to halt and un-halt the contract in case of an emergency, controlled by the owner.

The `unHalt` function in the `Haltable` contract is designed to allow the owner to set the `halted` state to `false`, effectively resuming normal operations of the contract after it has been halted. The function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure that only the owner can call it, and the `runIfHalted` modifier to ensure that it can only be called if the contract is currently in a halted state.

The provided ERC (which appears to be a description of the ERC-20 token standard) specifies a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of methods and events that a compliant token contract should implement to allow for token transfers, approvals, and other related functionalities.

The ERC-20 standard does not address halting or emergency stop mechanisms directly. It focuses on the token-related functionalities such as transferring tokens, querying balances, and setting allowances. Therefore, the `unHalt` function and the related halting mechanism in the `Haltable` contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard, as they are not related to the token transfer and approval mechanisms that the standard defines.

However, it is important to note that if the `Haltable` contract is part of a larger ERC-20 token contract, the halting mechanism could potentially affect the token's operations. For example, if the contract is halted, it might prevent token transfers and other ERC-20 operations from taking place. In such a case, the halting mechanism should be designed carefully to ensure that it does not inadvertently break compliance with the ERC-20 standard by making it impossible to perform the standard's required functions.

In summary, the `unHalt` function and the halting mechanism do not inherently violate the ERC-20 standard, but their implementation in a token contract must be done with care to maintain compliance with the standard's requirements for token operations.
