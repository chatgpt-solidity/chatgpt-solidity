The `cancelOrder` function and related parts of the `EZOToken` contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard, as the ERC-20 standard does not specify anything about order cancellation or the internal mechanisms of how a token should handle such functionality.

However, there are a few points to consider regarding adherence to the ERC-20 standard and general best practices:

1. **ERC-20 Compliance**: The provided code snippet does not show the implementation of the ERC-20 required functions such as `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, and `balanceOf`. To be fully ERC-20 compliant, the `EZOToken` contract must implement all of these functions and the associated events (`Transfer` and `Approval`).

2. **Minting Tokens**: The `mint` function is creating new tokens and assigning them to an address. This is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but it is not prohibited either. However, it is important to ensure that the minting process is well-controlled and that it does not lead to an unexpected inflation of the token supply.

3. **Event Emission**: The `mint` function emits a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `0x0`, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard for token creation events. However, the `cancelOrder` function emits an `orderCanceled` event, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard. This is acceptable as long as the contract also emits the standard `Transfer` event when tokens are transferred.

4. **Error Handling**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that functions should return a boolean value to indicate success or failure. The `assignEther` function uses `require(recipient.send(_amount))`, which will revert the transaction if the send fails. This is a valid way to handle errors, but it does not return a boolean as per the ERC-20 standard. This is acceptable since `assignEther` is an internal function and not part of the ERC-20 interface.

5. **Access Control**: The `mint` function requires that `allowedAddresses[msg.sender]` is `true`, which suggests that only certain addresses can mint new tokens. This is a good practice to prevent unauthorized minting, but it is not specified in the ERC-20 standard.

6. **Halting**: The `Haltable` contract and the `stopIfHalted` modifier allow the contract to be halted, which can prevent the execution of certain functions. This is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but it can be a useful feature for emergency stop mechanisms.

In summary, while the `cancelOrder` function and related parts do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard, it is important to ensure that the contract as a whole implements all required ERC-20 functions and follows best practices for security and functionality. The additional features and mechanisms (like order cancellation, minting, and halting) are not part of the ERC-20 standard but do not inherently conflict with it.
