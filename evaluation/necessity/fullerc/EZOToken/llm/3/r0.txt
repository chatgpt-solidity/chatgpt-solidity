Based on the provided Solidity code and the ERC-20 token standard, let's analyze whether the `EZOToken` contract adheres to the ERC-20 specification.

The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement. The provided `EZOToken` contract code snippet does not show the full implementation of all required ERC-20 functions and events, but we can still review the given parts for compliance.

Here are the key points from the ERC-20 standard that we can check against the provided code:

1. **totalSupply**: The ERC-20 standard requires a `totalSupply` function that returns the total token supply. The `EZOToken` contract has a `totalSupply` variable, but it does not have a corresponding public view function to return its value. This is a deviation from the standard.

2. **balanceOf**: The ERC-20 standard requires a `balanceOf` function that returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`. The `EZOToken` contract has a `balances` mapping, but it does not have a corresponding public view function to return the balance of an address. This is a deviation from the standard.

3. **transfer**, **transferFrom**, **approve**, **allowance**: The ERC-20 standard requires these functions to be implemented. The provided code snippet does not include these functions, so we cannot determine compliance based on the given code.

4. **Transfer** and **Approval** events: The ERC-20 standard requires these events to be emitted on successful calls to the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions. The provided code snippet does not include these events, so we cannot determine compliance based on the given code.

5. **Constructor**: The `EZOToken` contract's constructor sets the `totalSupply` and assigns the entire supply to the contract creator's balance. This is a common practice and does not violate the ERC-20 standard. However, the `isEZOToken` flag is not part of the ERC-20 standard and is specific to this contract's implementation.

6. **Decimals, Name, and Symbol**: The ERC-20 standard mentions that `decimals`, `name`, and `symbol` are optional functions. The provided code snippet does not include these, so their absence does not violate the standard.

Based on the provided code snippet, the `EZOToken` contract does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard because it lacks the required functions and events. To be compliant, the contract must implement all the functions and events as specified by the ERC-20 standard. It is important to note that the provided code is incomplete, and the missing parts might be implemented elsewhere in the contract. However, based on the given information, we can conclude that the contract does not meet the ERC-20 specification.
