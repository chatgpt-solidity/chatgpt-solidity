The provided Solidity code defines a `Haltable` contract that can be paused by the owner in case of an emergency. This contract is not directly related to the ERC-20 token standard, which is the standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain as described in the provided ERC (which appears to be ERC-20).

The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable interoperability with other contracts, wallets, and decentralized applications. These functions include `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, and a few others, along with the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.

The `Haltable` contract, on the other hand, is a utility contract that provides a mechanism to halt the operations of a contract in case of an emergency. This is a separate concern from the ERC-20 token functionality. The `halt` function and the `stopIfHalted` modifier are not part of the ERC-20 standard, and they do not directly interact with the token-related functions.

However, if the `Haltable` contract is used in conjunction with an ERC-20 token contract, it is important to ensure that the pausing functionality does not violate the expected behavior of the ERC-20 standard. For example, if the `halt` function is used to pause token transfers, it should be done in a way that is transparent to users and does not prevent them from transferring their tokens unless it is absolutely necessary (e.g., in the case of a detected vulnerability or attack).

In summary, the `Haltable` contract itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as it is not part of the standard's specification. However, if it is used within an ERC-20 token contract, care must be taken to ensure that the pausing functionality does not interfere with the standard operations of the token as defined by ERC-20. It is also important to communicate clearly to token holders when and why the halt function might be used, to maintain trust and transparency.
