The function `getPurchaseRecord` and the related parts provided in the `EZOToken` contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable token transfers and allow tokens to be approved for use by third parties.

The `getPurchaseRecord` function is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It appears to be a custom function specific to the `EZOToken` contract that retrieves purchase records associated with a given address. This function does not interfere with the ERC-20 required functions such as `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, `balanceOf`, and `totalSupply`, nor does it affect the `Transfer` and `Approval` events that must be emitted according to the standard.

As long as the `EZOToken` contract implements all the required functions and events as specified by ERC-20, and as long as it adheres to the behavior described in the standard (such as handling token transfers, approvals, and allowances correctly), the addition of custom functions like `getPurchaseRecord` does not constitute a violation of the ERC-20 standard.

It is important to note that the ERC-20 standard also does not restrict the addition of custom functionality to a token contract, as long as the core ERC-20 functionality remains compliant. Therefore, the `EZOToken` contract can include additional features and data structures, such as the `PurchaseRecordsAll` mapping and the `getPurchaseRecord` function, without violating the standard.
