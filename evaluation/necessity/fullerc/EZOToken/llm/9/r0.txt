The function `updateTxStatus` in the provided Solidity code does not directly relate to the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable token transfers and allow tokens to be approved for use by third parties. The standard functions include `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`, along with the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.

The `updateTxStatus` function appears to be a custom function that is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is used to update a mapping of transaction statuses, which is not a feature required or specified by ERC-20. As long as the implementation of the `updateTxStatus` function does not interfere with the standard ERC-20 functions and the contract still correctly implements all the required ERC-20 functions and events, it does not violate the ERC-20 standard.

However, it is important to note that adding custom functions and state variables to an ERC-20 token contract should be done with caution. Developers should ensure that these additions do not introduce security vulnerabilities, do not interfere with the expected behavior of the standard functions, and are well-documented for users and integrators of the token.

In summary, the `updateTxStatus` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the contract still adheres to all the required functions and events specified by the standard.
