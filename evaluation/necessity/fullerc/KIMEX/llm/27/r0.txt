The provided Solidity event interfaces are as follows:

```
event Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event ModifyWhiteList(address, bool);
event StartICO(uint256);
event EndICO(uint256);
event SetICOPrice(uint256);
event IssueTokens(address, uint256, uint256, uint256);
event AllocateTokensForFounder(address, uint256, uint256);
event AllocateTokensForTeam(address, uint256, uint256);
event AllocateReservedTokens(address, uint256);
event AllocateSalesTokens(address, uint256);
```

The given ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) is ERC-20, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 defines a set of rules that an Ethereum token contract must follow to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the required events are:

```
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

The provided event interfaces include the `Transfer` and `Approval` events with the correct parameters and indexed arguments, which are compliant with the ERC-20 standard.

However, the additional events listed (`ModifyWhiteList`, `StartICO`, `EndICO`, `SetICOPrice`, `IssueTokens`, `AllocateTokensForFounder`, `AllocateTokensForTeam`, `AllocateReservedTokens`, `AllocateSalesTokens`) are not part of the ERC-20 standard. These events seem to be related to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and token allocation mechanisms, which are not covered by ERC-20.

The presence of these additional events does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not prohibit the inclusion of additional events or functions. ERC-20 only specifies the minimum requirements for a token contract to be considered compliant. As long as the contract includes the required methods and events and adheres to their specified behavior, it can also include additional functionality that is not covered by the standard.

In conclusion, based on the provided event interfaces, the smart contract does not violate the ERC-20 standard, assuming that the required methods (not shown in the provided code) are also implemented according to the specification.
