The provided Solidity code for the `allocateReservedTokens` function and related parts of the `KIMEX` contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. ERC-20 Compliance: The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement. The provided code does not include the full implementation of the ERC-20 standard, such as the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` functions, as well as the `Transfer` and `Approval` events. To be ERC-20 compliant, the `KIMEX` contract must implement all of these functions and events.

2. Additional Functionality: The `allocateReservedTokens` function is an additional feature that is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is a custom function that allows the owner or admin to allocate reserved tokens to a specific address. This function does not conflict with the ERC-20 standard, as long as it does not interfere with the standard's required functions and events.

3. Event Emission: The `allocateReservedTokens` function emits an `AllocateReservedTokens` event, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard. Custom events are allowed as long as the required `Transfer` and `Approval` events are also implemented and emitted correctly according to the standard.

4. Token Accounting: The `allocateReservedTokens` function modifies the balance of an address by adding the allocated amount to the `balances` mapping. It is important that the `totalSupply` of tokens is correctly adjusted (if necessary) to reflect the total number of tokens in circulation, including any reserved tokens that are allocated. The ERC-20 standard requires that the `totalSupply` function returns the correct total token supply.

5. Security Considerations: The `allocateReservedTokens` function includes checks to ensure that the amount is greater than zero and that the address is not the zero address. These are good security practices. However, the function also uses the `SafeMath` library for safe arithmetic operations, which is a recommended practice to prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.

In summary, the `allocateReservedTokens` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but the `KIMEX` contract must implement all the required functions and events of the ERC-20 standard to be considered compliant. The custom function and event are acceptable as long as they do not interfere with the standard's requirements.
