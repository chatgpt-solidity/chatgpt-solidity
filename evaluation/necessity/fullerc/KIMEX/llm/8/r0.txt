The provided Solidity code for the `startICO` function and related parts of the `KIMEX` contract do not directly interact with the ERC-20 token standard interface. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable interoperability with other contracts, wallets, and exchanges.

The ERC-20 standard includes the following functions and events:

- `name()`
- `symbol()`
- `decimals()`
- `totalSupply()`
- `balanceOf(address _owner)`
- `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)`
- `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)`
- `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`
- `allowance(address _owner, address _spender)`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

The `startICO` function in the provided code is part of a contract that appears to be related to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) process. It sets the state of the contract to indicate that an ICO is in progress, initializes the ICO start time, and sets a flag to indicate that selling is active. It also emits a `StartICO` event, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard but is specific to this contract's functionality.

The `KIMEX` contract does not show any implementation of the ERC-20 token functions or events. It is possible that the `KIMEX` contract is separate from the actual token contract that implements the ERC-20 standard. If `KIMEX` is intended to be an ERC-20 token contract, it is missing the required functions and events specified by the standard.

In conclusion, the `startICO` function and related parts of the `KIMEX` contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard because they do not pertain to the token interface itself. However, if `KIMEX` is intended to be an ERC-20 token contract, it is not compliant with the standard as it does not implement the necessary functions and events. It is important to note that the provided code snippet is not sufficient to determine whether the `KIMEX` contract is intended to be an ERC-20 token contract or if it is a separate contract that manages the ICO process for an ERC-20 token.
