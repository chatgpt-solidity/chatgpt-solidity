The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code for the `KIMEX` contract has a couple of issues that may not be fully compliant with the ERC-20 token standard:

1. The `require(_value > 0);` condition in the `approve` function is not in line with the ERC-20 standard. According to the ERC-20 specification, there is no requirement that the `_value` must be greater than 0. The standard states that approvals of 0 values must be treated as normal approvals and should fire the `Approval` event. This requirement in the `KIMEX` contract could prevent users from setting the allowance to 0, which is a common practice for resetting allowances due to potential race conditions in the approve/transferFrom workflow.

2. The `transferable` modifier is used to restrict the execution of the `approve` function based on the `isTransferable` state variable. This is not part of the ERC-20 standard, which does not specify any conditions under which the `approve` function can be restricted. This additional logic could limit the interoperability of the token with other contracts and platforms expecting standard ERC-20 behavior.

To be fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should allow setting the allowance to any value, including 0, and should not be restricted by additional conditions such as the `isTransferable` flag. Here is a revised version of the `approve` function that would be more compliant with the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
// ERC20 compliant approve function
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) external returns (bool) {
    require(_spender != address(0), "Approve to the zero address");

    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

In this revised version, the `require(_value > 0);` condition and the `transferable` modifier have been removed to ensure compliance with the ERC-20 standard.
