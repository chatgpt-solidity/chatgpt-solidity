The provided Solidity code for the `allocateTokensForTeam` function and related parts of the `KIMEX` contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. ERC-20 Compliance: The ERC-20 standard defines a set of functions (`totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`) and events (`Transfer`, `Approval`) that a compliant token must implement. The provided code snippet does not show the implementation of these functions or events, so it is not possible to determine if the `KIMEX` contract is fully ERC-20 compliant based on the given code alone.

2. Token Allocation: The `allocateTokensForTeam` function is a custom function that is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is used to allocate tokens to a team address after certain conditions are met (e.g., the end of a sale and a lock period). This kind of function is often found in token contracts to handle the distribution of tokens to founders, team members, or advisors, and it does not conflict with ERC-20 as long as the standard functions and events are correctly implemented and triggered.

3. Transfer Event: According to the ERC-20 standard, a `Transfer` event must be triggered when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers. The provided code snippet does not show the `Transfer` event being triggered within the `allocateTokensForTeam` function. If the `Transfer` event is not being triggered elsewhere in the actual transfer logic (not shown in the snippet), this would be a violation of the ERC-20 standard.

4. SafeMath Library: The code uses the `SafeMath` library for safe arithmetic operations, which is a good practice to prevent overflow and underflow issues. This is not directly related to ERC-20 compliance but is important for contract security.

5. Access Control: The `allocateTokensForTeam` function is protected by the `isActive` and `onlyOwnerOrAdmin` modifiers, which restrict its execution to certain conditions and privileged users. This is a common practice for sensitive functions and does not violate ERC-20.

In conclusion, the `allocateTokensForTeam` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it is essential to ensure that the `Transfer` event is triggered when tokens are actually transferred, and that all other ERC-20 functions and events are correctly implemented in the full contract. Without the full contract code, it is not possible to determine full ERC-20 compliance.
