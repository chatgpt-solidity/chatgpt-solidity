The provided Solidity code for the `loadFund` function and related parts of the contract `KIMEX` do not directly interact with any ERC-20 token standard functions or events. The code snippet is part of a contract that seems to handle refunds by loading Ether (not ERC-20 tokens) into the contract.

The ERC-20 standard, as described in the provided ERC excerpt, specifies a standard interface for fungible tokens within smart contracts. It includes methods for transferring tokens, checking balances, and allowing tokens to be spent by approved third parties. It also defines two events, `Transfer` and `Approval`, which must be emitted on successful token transfers and approvals, respectively.

The `loadFund` function in the `KIMEX` contract is not related to the ERC-20 token standard because it deals with Ether transactions, not token transfers. ERC-20 functions and events are specific to the operations of token transfers, approvals, and allowances, none of which are present or affected by the `loadFund` function.

Therefore, the `loadFund` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it does not pertain to the ERC-20 token functionalities. It is simply a function to load Ether into the contract, which is a separate concern from the ERC-20 token operations. However, it is important to note that if the `KIMEX` contract is intended to be an ERC-20 token contract, it lacks the necessary ERC-20 functions and events as specified in the standard. If `KIMEX` is meant to be an ERC-20 compliant token, it would need to implement all the required functions and events listed in the ERC-20 specification.
