The provided Solidity code defines a simple contract `KIMEX` that inherits from an `Owner` contract. The `KIMEX` contract has a function `deActivate` that sets a boolean variable `inActive` to `true` when called by the owner of the contract. This function is intended to deactivate some functionality within the contract, presumably related to a token sale, as indicated by the comment.

The ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) provided appears to be a description of the ERC-20 standard, which is a common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to ensure interoperability with other contracts, wallets, and exchanges.

The `deActivate` function itself does not directly interact with any of the ERC-20 functions or change the behavior of the token in terms of transferring, approving, or querying balances. It seems to be a control mechanism for the contract owner to enable or disable certain features, which is not covered by the ERC-20 standard.

However, if the `inActive` flag were to be used to prevent token transfers, approvals, or any other ERC-20 related functionality, then it could potentially violate the ERC-20 standard if it prevents the expected behavior of these functions. For example, if the `transfer` function checked the `inActive` flag and disallowed transfers when `inActive` is `true`, this would not be compliant with the ERC-20 standard, which requires that transfers should only fail if the sender does not have enough balance.

Without seeing the full implementation of the `KIMEX` contract, particularly how the `inActive` flag is used throughout the contract, it is not possible to definitively say whether the contract violates the ERC-20 standard. The `deActivate` function itself is not in violation, but its effects on the contract's behavior could potentially be non-compliant if they interfere with the ERC-20 functions.

To ensure compliance, the contract should allow all the ERC-20 functions to operate as expected regardless of the state of the `inActive` flag, unless the purpose of the flag is to freeze all token operations for all users, which should be clearly documented and communicated to users.
