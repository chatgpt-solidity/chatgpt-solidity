The provided ERC is describing the ERC-20 token standard, which is a common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement.

Based on the ERC-20 standard, the following functions are required:

1. `totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
2. `balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`
3. `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
4. `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
5. `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
6. `allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)`

Additionally, the following events must be emitted:

1. `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
2. `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

Now, let's compare the provided list of Solidity function interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

- `transfer(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `transferFrom(address,address,uint256) returns(bool)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `approve(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `allowance(address,address) returns(uint256)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - Compliant with ERC-20.
- `symbol() returns(string)` - Compliant with ERC-20 (optional).
- `name() returns(string)` - Compliant with ERC-20 (optional).
- `decimals() returns(uint256)` - Compliant with ERC-20 (optional), but the return type should be `uint8` according to the standard.

The rest of the functions listed are not part of the ERC-20 standard. However, having additional functions does not necessarily mean that the contract violates the ERC-20 standard. It simply means that the contract has more functionality beyond what ERC-20 requires. The key is that the contract must implement all the required functions and events of ERC-20 to be considered compliant.

It's important to note that the ERC-20 standard does not specify the behavior of functions beyond the required set, so the additional functions in the provided list do not violate the standard as long as they do not interfere with the expected behavior of the ERC-20 functions.

In conclusion, based on the provided list of functions, the contract appears to be ERC-20 compliant, with the exception that the `decimals()` function should return `uint8` instead of `uint256` to fully adhere to the standard. The additional functions do not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as they do not alter the behavior of the required functions.
