The provided Solidity code for the `allocateTokensForFounder` function and related parts of the `KIMEX` contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. However, there are some considerations and potential issues that should be addressed:

1. **ERC-20 Compliance**: The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions (`totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`) and events (`Transfer`, `Approval`) that a compliant token must implement. The provided code snippet does not show these functions or events, so it is not possible to determine if the `KIMEX` contract is fully ERC-20 compliant. The `allocateTokensForFounder` function itself is not part of the ERC-20 standard, so it does not violate the standard by existing.

2. **Token Allocation**: The `allocateTokensForFounder` function allocates a predefined number of tokens to the founder's address. This is a common practice for token distributions, but it is important that this allocation is transparent and agreed upon by the community or investors. It should also be noted that the allocation should respect the total supply of tokens defined by the contract.

3. **Vesting**: The function seems to be designed for a one-time allocation with a vesting period of one year (`founderAllocatedTime` is set to 1 initially and then changed to 2 after allocation). However, the actual vesting logic (e.g., gradual release over time) is not implemented in the provided code. If the intention is to have a vesting period, the code should enforce this by releasing tokens gradually.

4. **Events**: The `AllocateTokensForFounder` event is emitted after the tokens are allocated to the founder. While this is not part of the ERC-20 standard, it is good practice to emit events for significant state changes. However, the standard `Transfer` event should also be emitted when tokens are transferred or allocated to comply with ERC-20.

5. **Access Control**: The function uses `onlyOwnerOrAdmin` modifier to restrict access to the owner or admin of the contract. This is a common practice for administrative functions.

6. **SafeMath**: The contract uses the `SafeMath` library for safe arithmetic operations, which is a good practice to prevent overflows and underflows.

In conclusion, the `allocateTokensForFounder` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but the overall compliance of the `KIMEX` contract with ERC-20 cannot be determined from the provided snippet. It is important to ensure that the contract implements all required functions and events of the ERC-20 standard and that the token allocation process is transparent and fair. Additionally, if vesting is intended, the logic should be properly implemented to enforce it.
