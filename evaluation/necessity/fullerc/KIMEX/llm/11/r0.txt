The provided Solidity code defines a contract `KIMEX` which inherits from a contract `Owner`. The `Owner` contract establishes an `owner` address and a modifier `onlyOwner` that restricts certain functions to be called only by the owner. The `KIMEX` contract has a function `activate` that can be called only by the owner to set the `inActive` state variable to `false`.

The ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) in question appears to be describing the ERC-20 standard, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable interoperability with other contracts, wallets, and marketplaces.

The ERC-20 standard includes the following functions and events:

- `name()`
- `symbol()`
- `decimals()`
- `totalSupply()`
- `balanceOf(address _owner)`
- `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)`
- `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)`
- `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`
- `allowance(address _owner, address _spender)`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

The `activate` function in the `KIMEX` contract does not directly relate to any of the ERC-20 standard functions or events. It appears to be a custom function that is not part of the ERC-20 specification. Therefore, the `activate` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard because the standard does not mandate the absence of additional functions beyond those listed in the specification.

However, it is important to note that while the `activate` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, the `KIMEX` contract itself may or may not be ERC-20 compliant based on whether it implements all the required functions and events as specified by the standard. The provided code snippet does not include the implementation of the ERC-20 functions, so we cannot determine the ERC-20 compliance of the `KIMEX` contract solely based on the given information.

In summary, the `activate` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but the compliance of the `KIMEX` contract with ERC-20 would depend on the implementation of the full set of required functions and events.
