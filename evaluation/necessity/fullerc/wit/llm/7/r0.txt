The provided Solidity code for the `createTokens` function and related parts of the smart contract are intended to be part of an ERC-20 token implementation. The ERC-20 standard is a widely adopted token standard in Ethereum that defines a common list of rules for Ethereum tokens to follow, allowing them to be shared, exchanged for other tokens, or transferred to a crypto-wallet.

The `createTokens` function in the provided code allows the contract owner to create new tokens and assign them to the owner's address. It also ensures that the creation of new tokens does not exceed the maximum token count (`MAX_TOKEN_COUNT`). When new tokens are created, a `Transfer` event is emitted with the `_from` address set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which is in line with the ERC-20 standard for token creation events.

Upon reviewing the provided code and the ERC-20 standard, here are some observations:

1. The `createTokens` function is not part of the ERC-20 standard. ERC-20 only specifies the basic functionality for transferring tokens and allowing them to be approved for third-party transfers. However, the inclusion of a token creation function does not inherently violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the other required functions and events are implemented correctly.

2. The `createTokens` function correctly emits a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `address(0)` when new tokens are created. This is in accordance with the ERC-20 standard, which states that a `Transfer` event should be triggered when tokens are created.

3. The `createTokens` function includes access control, allowing only the contract owner to create new tokens. This is a common pattern for mintable tokens, although it is not specified in the ERC-20 standard. Access control is a design choice and does not violate the standard.

4. The `createTokens` function uses `safeAdd` from the `SafeMath` contract to prevent overflow issues, which is a good practice for security.

5. The `createTokens` function returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, which is consistent with the ERC-20 standard's requirement that functions return a boolean success value.

6. The `AbstractToken` contract appears to implement the `balanceOf` function, which is required by the ERC-20 standard. However, the full implementation of the `AbstractToken` contract is not provided, so it is not possible to fully assess compliance with the ERC-20 standard.

7. The `WiT` contract does not show the implementation of other ERC-20 required functions such as `totalSupply`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`. For the contract to be ERC-20 compliant, these functions must be implemented according to the standard's specification.

In conclusion, the `createTokens` function and related parts of the provided code do not violate the ERC-20 standard. However, to fully assess ERC-20 compliance, the entire contract including all required functions and events must be reviewed. If the contract implements all the required functions and events as specified by the ERC-20 standard, and the `createTokens` function is an additional feature for token minting, then the contract can be considered ERC-20 compliant.
