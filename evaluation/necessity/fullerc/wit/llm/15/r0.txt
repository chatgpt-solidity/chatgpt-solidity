The provided Solidity event interfaces are:

```
event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event Freeze();
event Unfreeze();
event FrozenFunds(address, bool);
event RefundTokens(address, address, uint256);
```

The ERC in question appears to be the ERC-20 standard, which is a widely adopted token standard in the Ethereum ecosystem. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and events that a compliant token must implement.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the required events are:

```
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

Comparing the provided event interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

1. `event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);` - This matches the ERC-20 `Transfer` event specification, so it is compliant.

2. `event Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);` - This matches the ERC-20 `Approval` event specification, so it is compliant.

3. `event Freeze();` - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard. Including additional events does not necessarily violate the standard, but it does mean that the token contract has additional functionality beyond the standard.

4. `event Unfreeze();` - Similar to `Freeze`, this event is not part of the ERC-20 standard and represents additional functionality.

5. `event FrozenFunds(address, bool);` - This event is also not part of the ERC-20 standard and indicates that the contract may have a freezing mechanism for funds, which is not covered by the standard.

6. `event RefundTokens(address, address, uint256);` - This event is not part of the ERC-20 standard and suggests that the contract has a refund mechanism, which is not a requirement of the standard.

In conclusion, the `Transfer` and `Approval` events are compliant with the ERC-20 standard. However, the additional events `Freeze`, `Unfreeze`, `FrozenFunds`, and `RefundTokens` are not part of the ERC-20 standard. These additional events do not necessarily violate the standard, but they do indicate that the token contract includes extra functionality not covered by ERC-20. It's important to note that a token contract can be ERC-20 compliant while also providing additional features not specified in the standard.
