The provided Solidity code for the `mintToken` function and related parts of the smart contract appear to be implementing a token minting feature. To determine whether this function violates the given ERC (which is the ERC-20 standard based on the provided specification), we need to check if the implementation adheres to the ERC-20 token standard requirements.

Here are the key points to consider from the ERC-20 standard:

1. The `Transfer` event must be emitted when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.
2. A token contract that creates new tokens should trigger a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.
3. The `totalSupply` function should return the total token supply.
4. The `balanceOf` function should return the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
5. The `transfer` function should transfer `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and must throw if the sender's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
6. The `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance` functions are related to delegated token transfers and approvals.

Based on the provided code snippet and the ERC-20 standard:

- The `mintToken` function correctly checks that only the owner can call it (`require(msg.sender == owner);`).
- The `mintToken` function correctly emits the `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when new tokens are created (`emit Transfer(address(0), target, mintedAmount);`).
- The `mintToken` function correctly updates the `tokenCount` and the balance of the `target` address.
- The `mintToken` function returns a boolean indicating success, as per the ERC-20 standard's requirement for functions to handle boolean returns.

From the provided code and ERC-20 specification, it does not appear that the `mintToken` function violates the ERC-20 standard. However, it is important to note that the ERC-20 standard does not explicitly define a `mintToken` function. Minting functionality is an extension to the standard and is not part of the core ERC-20 functions. Therefore, as long as the minting process adheres to the standard's rules regarding state changes and event emissions, it can be considered compliant.

It is also worth mentioning that the `SafeMath` library is used to prevent overflow and underflow issues, which is a good practice for contract security.

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided code snippet and ERC-20 specification. A full contract audit would require reviewing the entire contract code, including the implementation of the `AbstractToken` and `Token` interfaces, to ensure full compliance with the ERC-20 standard and to check for any potential security issues.
