The provided Solidity code defines a contract `Ownable` that includes functionality to transfer ownership of the contract to a new owner. This is a common pattern used in many smart contracts to allow for administrative control over certain functions, typically restricted to the owner of the contract.

The ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) provided appears to be describing the ERC-20 standard, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a token contract should implement to enable interoperability with wallets, exchanges, and other contracts.

The `transferOwnership` function and related parts in the `Ownable` contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard because they are not part of the ERC-20 token functionality. The ERC-20 standard focuses on token-related operations such as transferring tokens, approving tokens to be spent by third parties, and querying token balances. It does not dictate how the administrative control of the contract should be managed or how ownership should be transferred.

The `Ownable` contract is a separate concern from the ERC-20 token functionality and is often used in conjunction with ERC-20 tokens to provide a layer of access control. It is important to note that the `Ownable` contract is not part of the ERC-20 standard itself, and its inclusion in a token contract is a design choice made by the contract developers.

In summary, the `transferOwnership` function and related parts do not violate the ERC-20 standard because they address a different aspect of contract behavior (ownership and access control) that is outside the scope of the ERC-20 token standard.
