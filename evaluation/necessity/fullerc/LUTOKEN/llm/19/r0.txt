The provided Solidity code defines a contract `LutToken` that inherits from several other contracts, including `Ownable`. The `setSale` function is designed to set the `sale` address and freeze all tokens by setting the `frozen` variable to `true`. This function can only be called by the owner of the contract, as it is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier.

The ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) provided is the ERC-20 standard, which is a common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a token contract should implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

The ERC-20 standard focuses on token transferability and does not directly address token freezing or ownership. The `setSale` function in the `LutToken` contract does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it does not interfere with the core ERC-20 functions such as `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`. These functions are expected to be implemented in the `LutToken` contract as part of the `LutTokenInterface`, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.

However, it is important to note that while the `setSale` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, the behavior of freezing tokens could affect the expectations of ERC-20 token holders. If the `frozen` variable is set to `true`, it could prevent token transfers, which would be an additional restriction not covered by the ERC-20 standard. This could be seen as a deviation from standard ERC-20 behavior, and it is crucial for the contract to clearly document this behavior and for users to be aware of it.

In summary, the `setSale` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but the token freezing behavior it introduces is an additional feature that is not part of the standard ERC-20 specification. As long as the core ERC-20 functions are correctly implemented and the additional behavior is well-documented, the contract can still be considered ERC-20 compliant with additional features.
