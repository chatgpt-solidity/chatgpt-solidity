The provided Solidity code for the `canUpgrade` function and the related parts from the `UpgradeableToken` contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token should implement to ensure interoperability with other contracts and clients, such as wallets and exchanges.

The ERC-20 standard includes the following functions:

- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`
- `transfer`
- `transferFrom`
- `approve`
- `allowance`

And the following events:

- `Transfer`
- `Approval`

The `canUpgrade` function is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It appears to be a custom function that is specific to the `UpgradeableToken` contract, which suggests that the token has some upgradeability feature. This function simply returns `true`, indicating that the token can be upgraded at any time.

Since the ERC-20 standard does not prescribe anything about upgradeability or additional functions beyond those listed in the standard, the presence of the `canUpgrade` function does not violate the standard. However, it is important to note that adding custom functions or features to an ERC-20 token can introduce additional complexity and potential security risks. It is crucial that these additional features are carefully designed and tested to ensure they do not compromise the token's compliance with the ERC-20 standard or the security of the token itself.

In summary, the `canUpgrade` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it is an additional feature that is not covered by the standard. As long as the `UpgradeableToken` contract implements all the required functions and events of the ERC-20 standard and adheres to the expected behavior of those functions and events, it can be considered ERC-20 compliant.
