The provided Solidity function `allowance` within the `StandardToken` contract appears to be compliant with the ERC20 standard as described in the given ERC documentation. The ERC20 standard specifies that the `allowance` function should:

- Return the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

The Solidity code provided for the `allowance` function does exactly that:

```solidity
function allowance(
    address _owner,
    address _spender
) public view returns (uint256) {
    return allowed[_owner][_spender];
}
```

It takes two arguments, `_owner` and `_spender`, and returns the remaining amount of tokens that `_spender` is allowed to transfer from `_owner`'s account. This is done by accessing the `allowed` mapping, which keeps track of all allowances set by token holders.

The ERC20 standard does not specify the exact implementation details, such as whether the function should be `public` or `external`, or whether it should use a specific type of visibility or mutability. The key requirement is that the function provides the functionality described in the standard, which in this case, it does.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the `allowance` function does not violate the ERC20 standard and is compliant with its specifications.
