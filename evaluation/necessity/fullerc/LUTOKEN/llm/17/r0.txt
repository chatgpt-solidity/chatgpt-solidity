The `decreaseApproval` function in the provided Solidity code is an extension to the ERC20 standard and is not part of the original ERC20 specification. The ERC20 standard defines a set of methods and events that a compliant token contract must implement, which includes `approve`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `balanceOf`, `allowance`, and corresponding events `Transfer` and `Approval`.

The `decreaseApproval` function is designed to safely reduce the allowance that an owner has given to a spender. This is a convenience function that can be used to avoid having to call `approve` twice (once to reset the allowance to zero and once to set it to the new value). This pattern is recommended to prevent a potential race condition described in the ERC20 standard:

> NOTE: To prevent attack vectors like the one described here and discussed here, clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before.

The `decreaseApproval` function checks if the `_subtractedValue` is greater than the current allowance (`oldValue`). If it is, it sets the allowance to 0. Otherwise, it subtracts the `_subtractedValue` from the `oldValue` using the `SafeMath` library's `sub` function, which ensures that the operation does not underflow. After updating the allowance, it emits the `Approval` event, as required by the ERC20 standard when allowances are changed.

In conclusion, the `decreaseApproval` function does not violate the ERC20 standard. It is an additional function that smart contract developers can include to provide a safer and potentially more gas-efficient way to decrease allowances. However, it is important to note that since `decreaseApproval` is not part of the ERC20 standard, not all ERC20 tokens will have this function, and interfaces that interact with ERC20 tokens should not rely on its presence.
