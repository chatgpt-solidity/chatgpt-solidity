The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and related parts of the `LutToken` contract must adhere to the ERC-20 token standard as described in the given ERC documentation.

Upon reviewing the provided code, here are some observations:

1. The `transferFrom` function in the `LutToken` contract calls `super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value);` without returning a value. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should return a boolean value indicating success or failure. This is a violation of the ERC-20 standard.

2. The `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract (which is presumably the parent contract of `LutToken`) correctly implements the ERC-20 standard by returning a boolean value.

3. The `LutToken` contract introduces additional logic with the `saleOrUnfrozen` modifier, which restricts token transfers when the contract is paused or when tokens are frozen, except for the sale account or the contract owner. This behavior is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but it does not necessarily violate the standard as long as the function still behaves correctly according to the ERC-20 specification when tokens are not frozen and the contract is not paused.

4. The `LutToken` contract also inherits from `Pausable`, which introduces a `paused` state that can prevent all token transfers when the contract is paused. This is an extension of the standard and does not violate ERC-20 as long as the `transferFrom` function returns false when the contract is paused, as per the ERC-20 requirement that callers must handle false returns.

5. The `LutTokenInterface` includes a `bool public freeze;` variable, but it is not clear how this variable is used in conjunction with the `frozen` variable in the `LutToken` contract. If `freeze` is meant to be the same as `frozen`, then having two variables for the same purpose could be confusing and potentially error-prone.

6. The `LutToken` contract does not seem to implement the `approve`, `allowance`, and `balanceOf` functions, which are part of the ERC-20 standard. However, these functions might be implemented in the inherited contracts that are not shown in the provided code.

To conclude, the main issue with the provided `transferFrom` function in the `LutToken` contract is that it does not return a boolean value as required by the ERC-20 standard. The additional restrictions introduced by the `saleOrUnfrozen` modifier and the `Pausable` contract do not violate the standard as long as they comply with the requirement to return false on failure. However, it is important to ensure that the rest of the ERC-20 functions are correctly implemented and that the contract's behavior is clearly documented, especially regarding the additional pausing and freezing features.
