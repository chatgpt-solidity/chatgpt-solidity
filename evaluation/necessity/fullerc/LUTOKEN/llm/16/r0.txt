The `increaseApproval` function provided in the Solidity code is not part of the original ERC20 token standard as defined in the given ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments). The ERC20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement, and `increaseApproval` is not one of them.

The standard ERC20 functions related to allowances are `approve` and `allowance`. The `approve` function sets the allowance for another address to spend a specific amount of tokens on behalf of the message sender. The `allowance` function returns the amount still available for the spender to withdraw from the owner's balance.

However, the `increaseApproval` function is a convenience function that many ERC20 token implementations, including OpenZeppelin, have adopted. It allows users to increase the allowance for a spender without having to set the allowance to zero first, which is a recommended practice to prevent certain attack vectors. This function is not part of the original ERC20 specification but is commonly used in practice to improve the user experience and contract efficiency.

The `increaseApproval` function in the provided code does not violate the ERC20 standard because it is an additional function that does not interfere with the standard's required functionality. It is an extension to the standard that many ERC20 tokens have implemented. The function correctly emits the `Approval` event, which is required by the ERC20 standard whenever the allowance amount is changed.

In conclusion, the `increaseApproval` function does not violate the ERC20 standard; it is an optional extension that is not required by the standard but is widely used in ERC20 token contracts to provide additional functionality.
