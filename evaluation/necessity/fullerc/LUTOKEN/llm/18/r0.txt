To determine whether the provided Solidity code for the `LutToken` contract and its related parts violate the given ERC (which appears to be ERC-20 based on the provided specification), we need to compare the contract's functions and events with the ERC-20 standard.

The ERC-20 standard specifies the following functions and events that must be implemented:

Functions:
- `totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
- `balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`
- `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)`

Events:
- `Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
- `Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

The provided code includes the following contracts that are relevant to the ERC-20 standard:

- `UpgradeableToken` does not directly relate to ERC-20 functions but seems to be a part of the token's upgrade mechanism.
- `Ownable` is a common pattern for ownership control, not directly related to ERC-20.
- `DetailedERC20` implements the optional ERC-20 functions `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`.
- `LutToken` is the actual token contract that should implement the ERC-20 standard.
- `BasicToken` seems to be a base contract for ERC-20, providing `totalSupply_` and `balances`.

Based on the provided code, we cannot see the implementation of the required ERC-20 functions (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`) or the required events (`Transfer`, `Approval`). However, the `LutToken` contract is derived from `StandardToken`, which is not included in the provided code. It is possible that `StandardToken` implements the required ERC-20 functions and events.

The `LutToken` constructor correctly initializes the `DetailedERC20` with the name, symbol, and decimals, and sets the total supply and initial balance for the `msg.sender`. This part does not violate the ERC-20 standard.

Without the full implementation of `StandardToken` and other potentially relevant contracts (like `BurnableToken`, `Pausable`, and `LutTokenInterface`), it is impossible to definitively say whether the `LutToken` contract violates the ERC-20 standard. We would need to review the full code of all inherited contracts to ensure compliance with ERC-20.

In summary, based on the provided code snippets alone, we cannot conclude that there is a violation of the ERC-20 standard. The full implementation of all related contracts would be required for a complete audit.
