The provided Solidity code for the `BurnableToken` contract appears to implement a burn function that allows token holders to destroy (burn) a certain amount of tokens from their balance. The `_burn` function is an internal function that actually performs the token burning operation.

The ERC-20 standard, as described in the provided ERC excerpt, does not explicitly define a burn function. The ERC-20 standard focuses on the transfer of tokens, the approval mechanism for third-party transfers, and the querying of token balances and allowances. The standard events are `Transfer` and `Approval`.

The `burn` function in the `BurnableToken` contract does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it is an additional feature that is not prohibited by the standard. The ERC-20 standard does not restrict the addition of extra functionality beyond what is specified in the standard. However, it is important to ensure that the additional functionality does not interfere with the standard's required behavior.

In the provided code, the `_burn` function correctly reduces the balance of the token holder (`_who`) by the specified `_value` and also reduces the `totalSupply_` of the token by the same amount. It then emits a `Burn` event, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard but is a common practice for burnable tokens to signal that tokens have been destroyed. Additionally, it emits a `Transfer` event with the destination address set to the zero address (`address(0)`), which is in line with the ERC-20 standard's requirement to emit a `Transfer` event when tokens are transferred, including when tokens are created or destroyed.

In conclusion, the `burn` function and related parts do not violate the ERC-20 standard. They provide additional functionality that is compatible with the standard's requirements. However, it is important to note that the `Burn` event is not part of the ERC-20 standard, so ERC-20 compliant interfaces and contracts should not expect this event to be present. The `Transfer` event with the zero address as the recipient is sufficient to indicate that tokens have been burned according to the ERC-20 standard.
