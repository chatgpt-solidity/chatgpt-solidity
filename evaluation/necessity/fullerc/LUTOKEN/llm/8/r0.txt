The provided Solidity code for the `UpgradeableToken` contract and its related parts do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided ERC text. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token should implement to ensure interoperability with other contracts and clients. These include:

- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`
- `transfer`
- `transferFrom`
- `approve`
- `allowance`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

The `UpgradeableToken` contract appears to be an extension of a standard ERC-20 token, with additional functionality to allow token holders to upgrade their tokens to a new contract. This upgrade mechanism is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but it does not conflict with it either. The ERC-20 standard does not prohibit additional functions or mechanisms in a token contract as long as the core ERC-20 functions and events are correctly implemented and behave as specified.

However, it is important to note that the provided code snippet does not show the implementation of the ERC-20 functions (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`) or the `Transfer` and `Approval` events. To fully assess compliance with the ERC-20 standard, those parts of the contract would need to be reviewed.

The `UpgradeableToken` contract includes an `upgrade` function that allows users to transfer their tokens to a new contract (the upgrade agent). This function reduces the token balance of the sender, decreases the total supply of the token, and calls the `upgradeFrom` function on the upgrade agent. It also emits an `Upgrade` event, which is specific to this upgradeable token mechanism and not part of the ERC-20 standard.

The `canUpgrade` function and the `getUpgradeState` function are also specific to the upgrade mechanism and do not conflict with ERC-20.

In conclusion, the upgrade mechanism provided in the `UpgradeableToken` contract does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but to ensure full compliance with ERC-20, the rest of the contract (not provided in the snippet) must implement all the required functions and events as specified by the standard.
