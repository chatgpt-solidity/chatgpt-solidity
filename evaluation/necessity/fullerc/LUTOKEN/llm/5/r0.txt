The provided Solidity code for the `totalSupply` function and the related parts from the `BasicToken` contract appear to be compliant with the ERC20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation.

The ERC20 standard specifies that the `totalSupply` function should:

- Return the total token supply.
- Be a public view function.
- Return a `uint256` value.

The Solidity code provided for the `BasicToken` contract meets these requirements:

```solidity
contract BasicToken is ERC20Basic {
    uint256 totalSupply_;

    /**
     * @dev total number of tokens in existence
     */
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
        return totalSupply_;
    }
}
```

The `totalSupply` function is marked as `public` and `view`, meaning it doesn't modify the state and can be called externally. It returns the `uint256` value stored in the `totalSupply_` variable, which represents the total number of tokens in existence.

There is no violation of the ERC20 standard in the provided `totalSupply` function and related parts of the `BasicToken` contract. However, it's important to note that the `BasicToken` contract should also implement the other functions and events specified in the ERC20 standard to be fully compliant, such as `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, and the `Transfer` and `Approval` events. The provided excerpt does not include these, so it's not possible to determine full compliance from the given code alone.
