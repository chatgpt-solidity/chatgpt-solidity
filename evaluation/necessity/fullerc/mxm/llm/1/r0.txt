The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and related parts of the `TokenERC20` contract must be evaluated against the ERC-20 token standard to determine if it complies with the standard's requirements.

Here are the key points from the ERC-20 standard that are relevant to the `transfer` function:

1. The `transfer` function should transfer `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to` and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
2. The function SHOULD throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
3. Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

1. The `_transfer` internal function checks that the `_to` address is not the 0x0 address, which is correct as per the standard.
2. It checks that the sender has enough balance to send the `_value` amount of tokens, which is also correct.
3. It checks for overflows when adding the `_value` to the recipient's balance, which is a good security practice.
4. It emits the `Transfer` event after updating the balances, which is required by the standard.
5. The `transfer` public function calls the internal `_transfer` function after checking that the sender is not on the blacklist.

However, there are a few issues and deviations from the ERC-20 standard:

- The `transfer` function does not return a boolean value. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value indicating success or failure. This is important for callers to handle the outcome of the transfer correctly.
- The `require` statements in the `_transfer` function will revert the transaction if any of the conditions fail, which is in line with the standard. However, the standard specifies that the function should return `false` rather than throwing an exception. This is a minor deviation, as the common practice in Solidity is to use `require` for input validation, which does throw exceptions on failure.
- The `Transfer` event is not defined in the provided code snippet. The ERC-20 standard requires the `Transfer` event to be declared with the `event` keyword and to have the `address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value` parameters. This event must be emitted on successful transfers. The code snippet does not include the event declaration, so it's not possible to verify if it's correctly implemented.
- The `blacklist` functionality is not part of the ERC-20 standard. While it's not strictly a violation of the standard, it is an additional feature that is not specified by ERC-20. This could potentially limit the token's interoperability with other contracts expecting a standard ERC-20 implementation.

In conclusion, the provided `transfer` function does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard due to the lack of a boolean return value. Additionally, the `Transfer` event declaration is missing from the provided code snippet, so it cannot be verified against the standard. The `blacklist` feature is an extra functionality that is not part of the ERC-20 standard.
