The provided Solidity function `approve` from the `TokenERC20` contract is intended to comply with the ERC-20 token standard, which is a common standard for implementing fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

Upon reviewing the `approve` function and the ERC-20 standard, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Blacklist Check**: The `approve` function includes a check for a `blacklist` mapping, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard. This check prevents addresses on the blacklist from approving tokens to be spent by others. While this is not part of the standard, it does not necessarily violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not forbid additional checks or functionality. However, it does add behavior that is not specified by the standard, which could lead to incompatibility with some ERC-20 interfaces that do not expect such behavior.

2. **Event Emission**: The ERC-20 standard requires that the `Approval` event must be triggered on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`. The provided code snippet does not show the event being emitted, which would be a violation of the standard. However, it is possible that the event is emitted elsewhere in the contract, and it's just not included in the provided snippet. To be compliant, the contract should include the following line within the `approve` function:
   ```solidity
   emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
   ```

3. **Return Value**: The `approve` function correctly returns a boolean value indicating success, as required by the ERC-20 standard.

4. **Re-approval Attack Prevention**: The ERC-20 standard notes that clients should set the allowance to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender to prevent certain attack vectors. The provided code does not enforce this, which is correct according to the standard, as it states "The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before."

In conclusion, the provided `approve` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard with the exception that it does not show the emission of the `Approval` event, which is required. The inclusion of a blacklist check is an additional feature that does not violate the standard but could potentially cause compatibility issues with some ERC-20 interfaces. To ensure full compliance, the contract should emit the `Approval` event when the `approve` function is successfully called.
