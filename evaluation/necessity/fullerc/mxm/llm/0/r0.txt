The provided Solidity code for the `TokenERC20` contract does not fully comply with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the given ERC documentation. Here are the key points of non-compliance and missing elements:

1. **Transfer and Approval Events**: The ERC-20 standard requires that the `Transfer` and `Approval` events be declared and emitted appropriately. The provided code does not include these events, which are essential for tracking token transfers and approvals.

2. **transfer Function**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that a `transfer` function must be implemented, which allows token holders to transfer their tokens to another address. This function is missing from the provided code.

3. **transferFrom Function**: The `transferFrom` function is also required by the ERC-20 standard, allowing a third party to transfer tokens on behalf of the token holder if they have been given an allowance. This function is not present in the provided code.

4. **approve Function**: The `approve` function is necessary for setting an allowance for a third party to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the token holder. This function is missing from the provided code.

5. **allowance Function**: The `allowance` function is required to return the remaining amount of tokens that a spender is allowed to withdraw from an owner's account. This function is not included in the provided code.

6. **Return Values**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that functions like `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` must return a boolean value indicating success or failure. The provided code does not include these functions, and therefore, it does not comply with the return value requirements.

7. **Handling of Decimals**: The provided code sets the `decimals` variable to 18, which is the suggested default. However, the ERC-20 standard states that the `decimals` function is optional and should be implemented to return the number of decimals the token uses. The provided code does not include a `decimals` function.

8. **Constructor**: The ERC-20 standard does not specify the constructor parameters or implementation. However, the provided code's constructor initializes the total supply and assigns it to the contract creator, which is a common practice. The constructor should also ensure that the initial supply is correctly calculated with the decimals.

In summary, the provided `TokenERC20` contract code does not implement several essential functions and events required by the ERC-20 standard. To be compliant, the contract needs to include the missing functions (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`) and events (`Transfer`, `Approval`), and ensure that functions return the appropriate boolean success value. Additionally, the contract should provide the optional `decimals` function for better usability, even though it is not strictly required by the standard.
