The `approveAndCall` function in the provided Solidity code is not part of the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement, and `approveAndCall` is not one of them.

However, the presence of `approveAndCall` in a token contract does not necessarily mean that the contract violates the ERC-20 standard. It could be an additional feature provided by the token contract that builds on top of the standard `approve` function. The `approveAndCall` function is a convenience function that allows a token holder to approve a spender and then immediately notify the spender's contract with additional data in a single transaction.

The ERC-20 standard requires the following functions and events:

- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`
- `transfer`
- `transferFrom`
- `approve`
- `allowance`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

As long as the contract correctly implements these functions and events, it can be considered ERC-20 compliant. Additional functions like `approveAndCall` do not affect compliance as long as they do not interfere with the standard behavior of the required functions.

However, there are a few points to consider in the provided `approveAndCall` function:

1. The `approveAndCall` function should handle the case where the `approve` function returns `false`. According to the ERC-20 standard, callers must handle `false` from returns (bool success). In the provided code, if `approve` returns `false`, the `approveAndCall` function will not return anything, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

2. The `approve` function in the provided code does not emit the `Approval` event, which is required by the ERC-20 standard whenever an approval is successfully made.

3. The `approveAndCall` function does not check for the return value of `spender.receiveApproval`. While this is not a requirement of the ERC-20 standard, it is a good practice to handle potential failures when calling external contracts.

To ensure full compliance with the ERC-20 standard and to improve the robustness of the `approveAndCall` function, the following changes should be made:

- Emit the `Approval` event in the `approve` function.
- Check the return value of the `approve` function in `approveAndCall` and handle the case where it returns `false`.
- Optionally, check the return value of `spender.receiveApproval` to handle potential failures when interacting with the spender's contract.

Here is a revised version of the `approve` function that emits the `Approval` event:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(!blacklist[msg.sender]);
    allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value); // Emit the Approval event
    return true;
}
```

And a revised `approveAndCall` function that checks the return value of `approve`:

```solidity
function approveAndCall(
    address _spender,
    uint256 _value,
    bytes _extraData
) public returns (bool success) {
    require(!blacklist[msg.sender]);
    tokenRecipient spender = tokenRecipient(_spender);
    if (approve(_spender, _value)) {
        // Check that the spender contract returns true for receiveApproval
        require(spender.receiveApproval(msg.sender, _value, this, _extraData));
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

With these changes, the contract would be more robust and still compliant with the ERC-20 standard, while also providing the additional `approveAndCall` functionality.
