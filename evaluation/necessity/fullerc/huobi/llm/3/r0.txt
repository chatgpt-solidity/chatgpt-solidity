The provided Solidity function `approve` from the `RegularToken` contract is intended to comply with the ERC-20 token standard, which is the standard interface for Ethereum tokens. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

The `approve` function in the ERC-20 standard allows a token holder to authorize another address (the spender) to transfer up to a specified number of tokens on their behalf. This is useful for enabling other contracts to interact with the tokens, such as when using a decentralized exchange.

Here is the relevant part of the ERC-20 standard for the `approve` function:

```
approve
Allows _spender to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the _value amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with _value. 
NOTE: To prevent attack vectors like the one described here and discussed here, clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before.
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```

The provided `approve` function in the `RegularToken` contract does the following:

1. It sets the allowance for the `_spender` to `_value` for the `msg.sender`.
2. It emits an `Approval` event with the `msg.sender`, `_spender`, and `_value`.

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This implementation is compliant with the ERC-20 standard. However, there are a couple of points to note:

- The ERC-20 standard mentions a known issue where changing the allowance from a non-zero value to another non-zero value can be exploited under certain conditions. It recommends that user interfaces should set the allowance to zero before setting it to a new value. However, the contract itself should not enforce this to maintain backward compatibility. The provided `approve` function does not enforce this, which is correct according to the standard.
- The `approve` function should be marked as `public` and should explicitly specify the `returns (bool success)` in the function signature to fully comply with the ERC-20 standard. The provided code does not include these modifiers, which could be an oversight or due to the code snippet being incomplete.
- The `Approval` event should be declared in the contract, and it should use the `event` keyword with the `indexed` parameters as specified in the ERC-20 standard. The provided code snippet does not show the event declaration, so it's not possible to verify if it's correctly implemented.

In conclusion, the provided `approve` function appears to be compliant with the ERC-20 standard, assuming that the `Approval` event is correctly declared elsewhere in the contract and that the function signature is correctly specified as `public returns (bool success)`. However, the code snippet provided is incomplete, and a full audit would require reviewing the entire contract code, including the event declarations and function modifiers.
