The provided Solidity function `transfer` is intended to be part of an ERC-20 token contract, as it deals with transferring token balances between accounts. To determine if the function complies with the ERC-20 standard, we need to compare it against the ERC-20 specification provided.

Here's a breakdown of the `transfer` function requirements from the ERC-20 standard and how the provided function matches up:

1. **Transfers _value amount of tokens to address _to**: The provided function accepts an address `_to` and a `uint _value` as parameters, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard.

2. **MUST fire the Transfer event**: The provided function does indeed fire the `Transfer` event when a transfer is successful, which is compliant with the standard.

3. **The function SHOULD throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend**: The provided function checks if `balances[msg.sender] >= _value` before proceeding with the transfer, which is correct. However, the ERC-20 standard suggests that the function should throw an error if the balance is insufficient. In Solidity, this is typically done using `require` statements, which revert the transaction if the condition is not met. The provided function instead returns `false` if the balance is insufficient, which is a deviation from the standard's recommendation.

4. **Note Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event**: The provided function does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0, but since it does not prevent it and would still fire the `Transfer` event, it is compliant with this part of the standard.

5. **The function returns (bool success)**: The provided function returns a boolean indicating the success of the transfer, which is compliant with the standard.

Based on the above points, the provided `transfer` function is mostly compliant with the ERC-20 standard. However, there is a deviation in how it handles insufficient balances. The ERC-20 standard suggests that the function should throw an error, while the provided function returns `false`. This could lead to different behavior in clients that interact with the token contract, as they must explicitly handle the `false` return value instead of catching a transaction revert.

To fully comply with the ERC-20 standard, the function should be modified to use a `require` statement to ensure that the transaction is reverted if the sender does not have enough tokens. Here is an example of how the function could be modified:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
    require(balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to], "Overflow detected");

    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

Note that in the modified version, `require` statements are used to ensure that the conditions are met, and the `Transfer` event is emitted with the `emit` keyword, which is the recommended way to emit events in newer versions of Solidity.
