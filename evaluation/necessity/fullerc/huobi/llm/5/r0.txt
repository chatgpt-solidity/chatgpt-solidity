The provided Solidity code for the `totalSupply` function and related parts of the smart contract are not fully compliant with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. Here are the issues:

1. The `totalSupply` function is missing the `public` visibility specifier. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `totalSupply` function should be declared as `public` so that it can be accessed externally.

2. The `totalSupply` function is missing the `view` modifier. The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `totalSupply` function should be a `view` function, meaning it should not modify the state of the contract and should be read-only.

3. The `totalSupply` function should return `uint256` instead of `uint`. In Solidity, `uint` is an alias for `uint256`, but the ERC-20 standard explicitly uses `uint256` for clarity and consistency.

4. The `constant` keyword is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity in favor of `view` and `pure`. The `constant` keyword was used in older versions of Solidity, but the ERC documentation specifies using Solidity 0.4.17 or above, where `view` is the appropriate keyword for read-only functions that do not modify the state.

5. The `totalSupply` function is missing an implementation. The ERC-20 standard requires that the function actually returns the total token supply, but the provided code does not have any logic to return this value.

Here is how the `totalSupply` function should be written to comply with the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
    return _totalSupply; // Assuming _totalSupply is a state variable holding the total supply value
}
```

In this corrected version, the function is `public`, uses the `view` modifier, returns `uint256`, and assumes there is a state variable `_totalSupply` that holds the total supply of tokens, which it returns.
