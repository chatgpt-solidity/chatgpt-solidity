The provided Solidity function `approve` from the `StandardToken` contract is intended to comply with the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies the `approve` function as follows:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
```

The `approve` function allows `_spender` to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

The provided `approve` function in the `StandardToken` contract is:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This function sets the allowance for `_spender` to `_value` and emits the `Approval` event, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard. However, there are a few issues to note:

1. The function signature does not include the `public` visibility specifier. In Solidity, functions are public by default, but it is considered good practice to explicitly state the visibility.

2. The `approve` function does not specify the `event Approval` with the `emit` keyword, which is the current standard practice for emitting events in Solidity (version 0.4.21 and later). The code provided seems to be using an older version of Solidity where the `emit` keyword was not yet introduced.

3. The ERC-20 standard mentions a known issue with the `approve` function related to the potential for a race condition. It suggests that clients should set the allowance to 0 before setting it to a new value for the same spender. The provided code does not enforce this, which is correct according to the standard, as it states "The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before."

4. The `approve` function should have a `returns (bool success)` return type, which is correctly implemented in the provided code.

5. The ERC-20 standard requires that callers MUST handle `false` from returns (bool success). The provided code always returns `true`, which is acceptable as long as there are no conditions under which the function would fail and need to return `false`.

In conclusion, the provided `approve` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it could be improved by explicitly stating the visibility of the function and using the `emit` keyword for emitting events if the Solidity version used is 0.4.21 or later. Additionally, while not a violation, it is important to be aware of the potential race condition issue when using the `approve` function, and user interfaces should handle this according to the best practices suggested by the ERC-20 standard.
