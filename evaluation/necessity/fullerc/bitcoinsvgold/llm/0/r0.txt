The provided Solidity function `transfer` is intended to be part of an ERC20 token contract, as it includes the `Transfer` event which is a requirement of the ERC20 standard. Let's compare the provided `transfer` function with the ERC20 standard requirements to see if there are any violations:

ERC20 `transfer` function requirements:
1. Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
2. The function SHOULD throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
3. Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

Provided `transfer` function:
```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] >= _value && _value > 0) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Analysis:
- The function checks if the sender (`msg.sender`) has enough balance to send the `_value` amount and that `_value` is greater than 0.
- If the conditions are met, it deducts the `_value` from the sender's balance, adds it to the recipient's balance, emits the `Transfer` event, and returns `true`.
- If the conditions are not met, it returns `false`.

Potential issues:
- The function does not throw an error if the sender does not have enough balance; it returns `false` instead. According to the ERC20 standard, the function SHOULD throw an error in this case. However, the ERC20 standard also notes that callers MUST handle `false` from returns, so this implementation is not strictly violating the standard, but it is not following the recommended best practice.
- The function checks `_value > 0` before proceeding with the transfer. This is not in line with the ERC20 standard, which states that transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event. The provided function would not emit a `Transfer` event for a transfer of 0 value, which is a violation of the ERC20 standard.

Conclusion:
The provided `transfer` function violates the ERC20 standard by not treating transfers of 0 values as normal transfers and not emitting the `Transfer` event in such cases. Additionally, while not a strict violation, the function's use of returning `false` instead of throwing an error when the sender does not have enough balance is not in line with the recommended best practice of the ERC20 standard.
