The `approveAndCall` function in the provided Solidity code is not part of the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement, and `approveAndCall` is not one of them.

The ERC-20 standard includes the following functions and events:

- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`
- `transfer`
- `transferFrom`
- `approve`
- `allowance`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

The `approveAndCall` function is an extension to the ERC-20 standard that some contracts implement to allow a token holder to approve a transfer of their tokens to a third-party contract and then immediately call a function on that contract in a single transaction. This can be useful for certain types of interactions with decentralized applications (dApps) that require token approval before performing an action.

However, the implementation of `approveAndCall` in the provided code has several issues:

1. The use of `throw` is deprecated in Solidity and should be replaced with `revert()` or `require()` for error handling. The `throw` keyword will consume all remaining gas and revert the transaction, whereas `revert()` and `require()` allow you to return unused gas and provide an error message.

2. The manual crafting of the function signature using `sha3` is outdated and should be replaced with the newer `keccak256` hashing function. Additionally, Solidity now supports the `encodeWithSignature` function, which simplifies this process.

3. The function does not check whether the `_spender` is a contract or not, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `_spender` is an externally owned account (EOA).

4. The function does not follow the ERC-20 standard's recommendation to set the allowance to zero before setting it to a new value to prevent certain attack vectors.

5. The function does not return a boolean value as per the ERC-20 standard's requirement for the `approve` function. Although `approveAndCall` is not part of the standard, it is modifying allowances and should ideally follow the same pattern of returning a boolean success value.

While `approveAndCall` is not part of the ERC-20 standard and does not violate the standard by its presence, the implementation provided has several issues that should be addressed to follow best practices and ensure compatibility with modern Solidity versions and security considerations.
