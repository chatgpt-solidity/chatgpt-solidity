The `balanceOf` function provided in the Solidity code snippet is intended to be part of an ERC-20 token contract. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered compliant. Let's compare the provided `balanceOf` function with the ERC-20 specification for the same function.

The ERC-20 `balanceOf` function is specified as follows:

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);
```

The provided `balanceOf` function in the Solidity code snippet is:

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint256 balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
}
```

Here are the points to consider when auditing the provided `balanceOf` function:

1. **Visibility Modifier**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `balanceOf` function should be `public`. In the provided code, there is no visibility modifier, which by default makes it `public` in Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0. However, it is considered good practice to explicitly state the visibility modifier for clarity.

2. **View Modifier**: The ERC-20 standard uses the `view` modifier to indicate that the function does not modify the state. In the provided code, the `constant` modifier is used, which is equivalent to `view` in Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0. In Solidity 0.5.0 and later, the `constant` keyword is deprecated, and `view` should be used instead.

3. **Return Variable Name**: The ERC-20 standard specifies a return variable name `balance`, which is also used in the provided code. This is not a strict requirement, as the name of the return variable does not affect the function signature or the ABI.

4. **Function Behavior**: The provided `balanceOf` function correctly returns the balance of the address `_owner` from the `balances` mapping, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard.

Based on the above points, the provided `balanceOf` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard. However, if the Solidity compiler version being used is 0.5.0 or later, it is recommended to replace `constant` with `view` and to explicitly state the `public` visibility modifier for the function to ensure clarity and future compatibility. Additionally, it is important to note that the rest of the contract (not provided in the snippet) must also implement the other required functions and events as specified by the ERC-20 standard to be fully compliant.
