The provided Solidity function interfaces are meant to be compared against the ERC-20 token standard, which is the ERC specified in the provided text. The ERC-20 standard defines a common list of rules that an Ethereum token has to implement, giving developers the ability to program how new tokens will function within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Let's compare the provided function interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

1. `transfer(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - **Compliant**
2. `transferFrom(address,address,uint256) returns(bool)` - **Compliant**
3. `balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)` - **Compliant**
4. `approve(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - **Compliant**
5. `allowance(address,address) returns(uint256)` - **Compliant**
6. `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - **Compliant**
7. `BITCOINSVGOLD() returns()` - **Not part of ERC-20**
8. `fallback() returns()` - **Not part of ERC-20** and also not compliant with the standard fallback function as it should not return anything.
9. `approveAndCall(address,uint256,bytes) returns(bool)` - **Not part of ERC-20**
10. `name() returns(string)` - **Compliant** (Optional)
11. `decimals() returns(uint8)` - **Compliant** (Optional)
12. `fundsWallet() returns(address)` - **Not part of ERC-20**
13. `symbol() returns(string)` - **Compliant** (Optional)
14. `unitsOneEthCanBuy() returns(uint256)` - **Not part of ERC-20**
15. `version() returns(string)` - **Not part of ERC-20**
16. `totalEthInWei() returns(uint256)` - **Not part of ERC-20**
17. `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - **Compliant** (Duplicate, already listed)

The ERC-20 standard also requires two events to be emitted:
- `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
- `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

These events are not listed in the provided interfaces, but they are a crucial part of the ERC-20 standard. The contract must implement these events to be fully compliant.

In summary, the provided list of function interfaces includes all the necessary functions for ERC-20 compliance, but it also includes additional functions that are not part of the standard. The presence of extra functions does not necessarily mean the token is not ERC-20 compliant, as long as the required functions and events are correctly implemented. However, the `fallback()` function is not compliant with the standard as it should not return anything. Additionally, the contract must implement the required `Transfer` and `Approval` events to be fully compliant with ERC-20.
