The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and the related `_transfer` internal function appears to be a simplified implementation of an ERC20 token transfer mechanism. To determine if the code violates the given ERC (which is the ERC20 standard), we need to compare the implementation with the ERC20 specification.

Here are the key points from the ERC20 specification regarding the `transfer` function:

1. The `transfer` function should transfer `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to` and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
2. The function SHOULD throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
3. Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

1. The `transfer` function calls an internal `_transfer` function, passing the `msg.sender` as the `_from` address, the `_to` address, and the `_value` to transfer.
2. The `_transfer` function checks that the `_to` address is not the 0x0 address, which is a good practice to prevent burning tokens by sending them to an unrecoverable address.
3. It checks that the sender has enough balance to cover the transfer amount.
4. It checks for overflows when adding the value to the recipient's balance.
5. It updates the balances of the sender and the recipient.
6. It emits the `Transfer` event.
7. It uses an `assert` statement to ensure that the sum of the sender's and recipient's balances remains the same before and after the transfer, which is a way to check for invariants in the contract's logic.

Based on the provided code and the ERC20 specification, the `transfer` function implementation does not seem to violate the ERC20 standard. It includes the necessary checks, updates balances accordingly, and emits the `Transfer` event as required.

However, there are a few points to consider for a complete ERC20 token contract that are not covered by the provided code snippet:

- The contract does not include the `approve`, `allowance`, and `transferFrom` functions, which are also part of the ERC20 standard.
- The contract does not define the `totalSupply` function or a variable, which is necessary to track the total number of tokens in existence.
- The contract does not include optional functions like `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`, which provide additional information about the token.
- The code does not handle the case where `_value` is zero explicitly, but since there are no checks preventing it, zero-value transfers would still work and emit the `Transfer` event, which is compliant with the standard.

To fully comply with the ERC20 standard, the contract would need to implement all the required functions and events specified in the ERC. The provided code snippet is a partial implementation and would need additional code to be a complete ERC20 token contract.
