The provided Solidity function interfaces are meant to represent an ERC-20 token contract, which is a standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement.

Let's compare the provided function interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

1. `constructor() returns()` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but it's common for contracts to have a constructor for initialization purposes.

2. `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

3. `transfer(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

4. `transferFrom(address,address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

5. `approve(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

6. `approveAndCall(address,uint256,bytes) returns(bool)` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It seems to be an extension that allows for a single transaction to approve and call another contract.

7. `giveBlockReward() returns()` - This is not part of the ERC-20 standard and seems to be a custom function unrelated to token standards.

8. `name() returns(string)` - This is an optional part of the ERC-20 standard.

9. `balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

10. `decimals() returns(uint8)` - This is an optional part of the ERC-20 standard.

11. `symbol() returns(string)` - This is an optional part of the ERC-20 standard.

12. `allowance(address,address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

13. `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - This is a duplicate of the second function and should not be declared twice.

The ERC-20 standard also requires two events to be declared:

- `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
- `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

These events are not listed in the provided interfaces, but they are a crucial part of the ERC-20 standard. A compliant ERC-20 token contract must implement these events to notify watchers of token transfers and approvals.

In summary, the provided function interfaces mostly comply with the ERC-20 standard, with the following exceptions:

- The `approveAndCall` function is not part of the standard.
- The `giveBlockReward` function is not part of the standard.
- The `totalSupply` function is listed twice, which is likely a mistake.
- The required `Transfer` and `Approval` events are not included in the provided interfaces.

To fully comply with the ERC-20 standard, the contract should remove non-standard functions (unless they are part of an intentional extension), ensure there are no duplicate function declarations, and include the required `Transfer` and `Approval` events.
