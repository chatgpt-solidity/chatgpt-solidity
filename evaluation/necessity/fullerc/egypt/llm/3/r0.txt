The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and the related parts of the contract named `Egypt` appear to be compliant with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. Here's a breakdown of the compliance with the key aspects of the `transferFrom` function as per the ERC-20 standard:

1. **Transfers _value amount of tokens from address _from to address _to**: The `transferFrom` function in the `Egypt` contract takes `_from`, `_to`, and `_value` as parameters, which is consistent with the ERC-20 specification.

2. **MUST fire the Transfer event**: The `_transfer` internal function, which is called by `transferFrom`, emits the `Transfer` event, as required by the ERC-20 standard.

3. **The function SHOULD throw if the _from account has not authorized the sender**: The `transferFrom` function checks that the `msg.sender` is authorized to spend the specified `_value` of tokens from the `_from` account by requiring that `_value` is less than or equal to the allowance set for `msg.sender` by `_from`. If this is not the case, the function will revert due to the `require` statement.

4. **Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event**: The code does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0, which means that a transfer of 0 value would be processed like any other transfer and would result in the `Transfer` event being emitted, as per the ERC-20 standard.

5. **The function SHOULD throw unless the _from account has deliberately authorized the sender**: The `require` statement ensures that the `msg.sender` has been authorized by the `_from` account to spend the tokens.

6. **The function SHOULD throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend**: The `_transfer` internal function checks that the `_from` account has enough balance to cover the `_value` being transferred. If not, the function will revert.

7. **The function SHOULD throw for invalid addresses (e.g., 0x0)**: The `_transfer` internal function checks that the `_to` address is not the 0x0 address, which is a common check to prevent burning tokens by sending them to an unrecoverable address.

Based on the provided code and the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function and related parts of the `Egypt` contract do not appear to violate the ERC-20 standard. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided snippets. A full audit would require reviewing the entire contract, including any inherited contracts, modifiers, and other related functions, to ensure complete compliance with the ERC-20 standard and to check for any security issues or logical errors.
