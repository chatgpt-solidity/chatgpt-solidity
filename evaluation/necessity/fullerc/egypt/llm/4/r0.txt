The provided `approve` function in the `Egypt` contract appears to comply with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard specifies the following for the `approve` function:

- Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
- The function should return a boolean value indicating success.
- The contract should emit an `Approval` event on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

The `approve` function in the `Egypt` contract does the following:

- It sets the allowance for `_spender` to spend `_value` tokens on behalf of `msg.sender`.
- It returns a boolean value (`true`) indicating that the operation was successful.
- It emits an `Approval` event with the `msg.sender`, `_spender`, and `_value` as arguments.

This behavior is consistent with the ERC-20 standard's requirements for the `approve` function.

However, the ERC-20 standard also includes a note regarding a known potential security issue with the `approve` function:

- To prevent attack vectors like the one described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1On0nQk9QwZ_Nqv9jQ5sghSNn7X8PYzlF-Q0biX-4uGs/edit) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729), clients should make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. Though the contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backward compatibility with contracts deployed before.

The provided `approve` function does not enforce setting the allowance to 0 before setting it to another value, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard's recommendation for backward compatibility. It is the responsibility of the user interface or off-chain components to handle this potential security issue properly.

In conclusion, the `approve` function and related parts in the `Egypt` contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard as described in the provided documentation. However, it is important to note that the ERC-20 standard has known security considerations that should be addressed at the user interface level.
