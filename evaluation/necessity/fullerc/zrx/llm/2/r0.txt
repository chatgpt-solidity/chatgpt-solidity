The `balanceOf` function provided in the Solidity code snippet is intended to be part of an ERC-20 token contract. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered compliant. Let's compare the provided `balanceOf` function with the ERC-20 specification for the same function.

The ERC-20 `balanceOf` function is specified as follows:

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);
```

The provided `balanceOf` function in the Solidity code snippet is:

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint) {
    return balances[_owner];
}
```

Here are the points of comparison:

1. **Visibility Modifier**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `balanceOf` function should be `public` and `view`. In the provided code, the function uses the `constant` keyword, which is an alias for `view` in older versions of Solidity. However, the visibility modifier `public` is missing. In Solidity, if no visibility is specified, it defaults to `public`, so the function is implicitly public. This is not a violation, but it is good practice to explicitly state the visibility for clarity.

2. **Return Type**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that the return type should be `uint256`. In the provided code, the return type is `uint`, which in Solidity is an alias for `uint256`. Therefore, there is no violation here.

3. **Function Behavior**: The function correctly returns the balance of the address `_owner` from the `balances` mapping, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard.

Based on the comparison, the provided `balanceOf` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard. However, it is important to note that the `constant` keyword is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity, and it is recommended to use `view` instead for functions that do not modify the state. Additionally, explicitly stating the visibility as `public` would improve the clarity of the code.

It is also worth mentioning that the ERC-20 standard requires additional functions and events to be implemented for full compliance, such as `transfer`, `approve`, `allowance`, `Transfer` event, and `Approval` event. The provided code snippet only includes the `balanceOf` function, so the rest of the contract would need to be reviewed to ensure full ERC-20 compliance.
