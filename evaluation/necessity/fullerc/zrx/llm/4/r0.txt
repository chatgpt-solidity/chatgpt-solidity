The `allowance` function provided in the Solidity code snippet is intended to be part of an ERC-20 token contract. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement. The `allowance` function is one of these required functions.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function is defined as follows:

```solidity
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```

The purpose of the `allowance` function is to return the amount of tokens that an `_owner` has allowed an `_spender` to withdraw from their account.

Now, let's compare the provided `allowance` function with the ERC-20 specification:

```solidity
contract StandardToken is Token {
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) allowed;

    function allowance(
        address _owner,
        address _spender
    ) constant returns (uint) {
        return allowed[_owner][_spender];
    }
}
```

Here are the key points to consider:

1. The `allowance` function in the provided code uses the `constant` keyword, which is an older Solidity syntax for specifying that a function does not modify the state. In newer versions of Solidity, the `view` keyword is used instead. However, `constant` is still valid for the version of Solidity mentioned in the ERC (0.4.17 or above), and it has the same effect as `view` in this context.

2. The return type in the provided code is `uint`, which is an alias for `uint256` in Solidity. This is consistent with the ERC-20 standard, which requires the return type to be `uint256`.

3. The provided code does not specify the visibility of the `allowance` function. In Solidity, if no visibility is specified, the default is `public`. The ERC-20 standard requires the `allowance` function to be `public`, so this is compliant.

4. The provided code does not include the `returns` keyword in the function signature. This is a minor syntactical oversight, but it does not affect the functionality of the function. The function still returns the expected value.

Based on the above points, the provided `allowance` function appears to be compliant with the ERC-20 standard. It correctly implements the functionality to return the remaining allowance that an `_owner` has granted to an `_spender`. However, it is important to note that the `constant` keyword is outdated, and modern Solidity code should use `view` instead. Additionally, including the `returns` keyword in the function signature would be more consistent with the standard's specification and current Solidity best practices.
