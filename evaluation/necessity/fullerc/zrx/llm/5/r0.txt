The provided Solidity code for the `totalSupply` function in the `Token` contract is incomplete and does not fully comply with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. Here are the issues with the provided `totalSupply` function:

1. **Visibility Modifier**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `totalSupply` function should have a `public` visibility modifier, allowing it to be called externally. The provided code does not specify the visibility, which in Solidity defaults to `internal`. This means it would not be callable by external contracts or transactions, which is a violation of the standard.

2. **View Modifier**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `totalSupply` function should be a `view` function, meaning it does not modify the state and can be called without any gas cost (if called externally and not as part of a transaction that modifies the state). The provided code uses the `constant` keyword, which in older versions of Solidity is similar to `view`, but the ERC documentation specifies using Solidity 0.4.17 or above, where the `view` keyword is the standard.

3. **Return Type**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `totalSupply` function should return a `uint256`. The provided code uses `uint` which is an alias for `uint256` in Solidity, so this is not a violation, but it's worth noting that the ERC documentation explicitly uses `uint256`.

4. **Return Value**: The provided `totalSupply` function does not return any value, which means it does not comply with the ERC-20 standard that requires the function to return the total token supply.

5. **Function Documentation**: The provided code includes a comment that describes the function, but it does not provide any Solidity NatSpec comments that would be useful for generating user-friendly documentation.

Here is how the `totalSupply` function should be written to comply with the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.17; // or a more recent version

contract Token {
    uint256 private _totalSupply;

    /// @notice Get the total token supply
    /// @return The total token supply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
        return _totalSupply;
    }

    // Other ERC-20 functions and events
}
```

In this corrected version, the function is `public`, uses the `view` modifier, and returns a `uint256` that represents the total supply of the tokens. The `_totalSupply` variable would be a state variable that tracks the total supply of tokens.

To fully comply with the ERC-20 standard, the `Token` contract would also need to implement the other functions and events specified in the ERC documentation, such as `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, and the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.
