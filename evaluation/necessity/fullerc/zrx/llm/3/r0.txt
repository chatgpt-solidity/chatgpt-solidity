The provided Solidity function `approve` from the `StandardToken` contract is intended to comply with the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 standard specifies the `approve` function as follows:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
```

The `approve` function allows `_spender` to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

The provided `approve` function in the `StandardToken` contract is:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This function sets the allowance for `_spender` to `_value` and emits the `Approval` event, which is in line with the ERC20 standard. However, there are a few issues to note:

1. The function signature does not include the `public` visibility specifier. In Solidity, functions are public by default, but it is considered good practice to explicitly state the visibility.

2. The function does not specify the `returns` keyword with the type `bool`. While the function does return a boolean value, it is best practice to follow the ERC20 standard's function signature exactly.

3. The ERC20 standard mentions a known issue with the `approve` function related to the potential for a race condition in a specific situation. To mitigate this, it is recommended that the client interface should set the allowance to 0 before setting it to a new value for the same spender. The contract itself does not enforce this, but it is something to be aware of when interacting with the `approve` function.

4. The `approve` function should emit the `Approval` event with the correct parameters. The provided code does not specify the `event Approval` declaration, but it is assumed to be declared elsewhere in the contract with the correct signature as per the ERC20 standard.

5. The `approve` function does not check for the return value of the `Approval` event. While this is not strictly necessary, some implementations may include additional checks or logic when emitting events.

6. The code snippet does not include the `pragma` directive to specify the Solidity compiler version, which is mentioned in the ERC20 standard notes. It is important to use a compatible compiler version to ensure that the contract behaves as expected.

In conclusion, the provided `approve` function mostly adheres to the ERC20 standard, but it lacks the `public` visibility specifier and the explicit `returns (bool success)` in the function signature. Additionally, while not a violation of the standard, the known issue with the `approve` function should be handled at the interface level to prevent potential race conditions.
