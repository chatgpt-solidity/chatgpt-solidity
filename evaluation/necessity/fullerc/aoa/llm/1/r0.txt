The provided `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract appears to be an implementation of the ERC20 standard's `transferFrom` method. To determine if the function violates the given ERC (which is essentially the ERC20 standard), we need to compare the function's behavior with the ERC20 specification.

Here are the key points from the ERC20 specification regarding the `transferFrom` method:

1. Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
2. The function SHOULD throw unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
3. Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

Now, let's analyze the provided `transferFrom` function:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) public returns (bool success) {
    if (
        balances[_from] >= _value &&
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value &&
        _value > 0
    ) {
        balances[_to] += _value;
        balances[_from] -= _value;
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

The function checks if the `_from` address has enough balance and if the `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer the specified `_value` of tokens. If both conditions are met and `_value` is greater than 0, it performs the transfer, updates the balances, reduces the allowance, emits the `Transfer` event, and returns `true`.

However, there are a couple of issues with this implementation:

1. The function does not throw an error when the balance or allowance is insufficient; instead, it returns `false`. According to the ERC20 standard, the function SHOULD throw in such cases. This can be addressed by using `require` statements instead of `if` conditions to ensure that the function reverts on failure.

2. The function includes a check for `_value > 0`, which is not in line with the ERC20 specification. The ERC20 standard states that transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event. The current implementation would return `false` without transferring or emitting an event if `_value` is 0, which violates the standard.

To comply with the ERC20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should be modified to throw an error when the balance or allowance is insufficient and to allow transfers of 0 values. Here's a revised version of the function that addresses these issues:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balances[_from] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
    require(allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient allowance");
    balances[_to] += _value;
    balances[_from] -= _value;
    allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value); // Updated to use 'emit' for Solidity 0.4.21 or later
    return true;
}
```

Additionally, the `Transfer` event should be emitted using the `emit` keyword, which is a best practice for Solidity version 0.4.21 and later. The original code does not use `emit`, which is not a violation of the ERC20 standard but is considered outdated syntax.

In conclusion, the provided `transferFrom` function violates the ERC20 standard by not allowing transfers of 0 values and by not throwing an error when the balance or allowance is insufficient. The revised function above addresses these issues and complies with the ERC20 standard.
