The `allowance` function provided in the Solidity code snippet is intended to be part of an ERC-20 token contract. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a token contract must implement to be considered compliant. The `allowance` function is one of these required functions.

The ERC-20 standard for the `allowance` function is as follows:

```solidity
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```

The provided `allowance` function in the Solidity code snippet matches the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
function allowance(
    address _owner,
    address _spender
) public constant returns (uint256 remaining) {
    return allowed[_owner][_spender];
}
```

However, there is a minor discrepancy in the use of the `constant` keyword instead of `view`. In Solidity, the `constant` keyword was used in earlier versions to indicate that a function does not alter the state of the contract. In more recent versions of Solidity (0.4.17 and above, as mentioned in the ERC), the `constant` keyword has been replaced by `view` and `pure`. The `view` keyword should be used for functions that do not modify the state but do read from it.

Despite this minor discrepancy, the functionality of the `allowance` function is correct and does not violate the ERC-20 standard. It correctly returns the amount that `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

To fully comply with the latest Solidity standards and best practices, the `constant` keyword should be replaced with `view`. Here is the updated function signature:

```solidity
function allowance(
    address _owner,
    address _spender
) public view returns (uint256 remaining) {
    return allowed[_owner][_spender];
}
```

This change would ensure that the contract adheres to the latest Solidity conventions without affecting its ERC-20 compliance.
