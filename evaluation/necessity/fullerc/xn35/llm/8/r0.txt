The provided Solidity function interfaces are meant to be compared against the ERC-20 token standard, which is the ERC specified in the provided documentation. The ERC-20 standard outlines a common set of rules for Ethereum tokens to follow, allowing them to be shared, exchanged, and transferred on Ethereum networks.

Here's a comparison of the provided interfaces against the ERC-20 standard:

1. `transferOwnership(address) returns()` - This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is typically found in Ownable contracts for administrative control and not required by ERC-20.

2. `constructor() returns()` - The ERC-20 standard does not specify a constructor; however, constructors are a part of contract initialization and not part of the ERC-20 interface.

3. `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

4. `balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

5. `transfer(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

6. `transferFrom(address,address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

7. `approve(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

8. `allowance(address,address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

9. `_totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - This is likely an internal function to keep track of the total supply. It is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but it does not violate it as long as `totalSupply()` is correctly implemented.

10. `name() returns(string)` - This is an optional method in ERC-20 and is correctly implemented.

11. `decimals() returns(uint8)` - This is an optional method in ERC-20 and is correctly implemented.

12. `symbol() returns(string)` - This is an optional method in ERC-20 and is correctly implemented.

13. `owner() returns(address)` - This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is typically found in Ownable contracts for administrative control and not required by ERC-20.

14. `balances(address) returns(uint256)` - This is likely an internal function to access the balance mapping. It is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but it does not violate it as long as `balanceOf(address)` is correctly implemented.

The provided list of functions does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it includes additional functions (`transferOwnership`, `owner`, `_totalSupply`, `balances`) that are not required by ERC-20. These additional functions are commonly found in token contracts for administrative purposes or internal mechanisms and do not conflict with the standard as long as the required ERC-20 functions are correctly implemented and behave as specified.

It is important to note that the actual compliance with the ERC-20 standard also depends on the implementation of these functions and the associated events (`Transfer` and `Approval`), which must be correctly emitted according to the standard's requirements. The provided interfaces do not include event definitions, so it is assumed that they are implemented elsewhere in the contract.
