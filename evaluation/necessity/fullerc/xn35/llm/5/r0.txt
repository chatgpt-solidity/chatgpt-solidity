The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and related parts of the `Projecton` contract need to be compared against the ERC-20 token standard to determine if there are any violations.

Here's a breakdown of the ERC-20 `transferFrom` function requirements and how the provided code matches up:

1. **Transfers _value amount of tokens from address _from to address _to**: The provided code does this correctly by subtracting the `_value` from the `_from` address's balance and adding the same `_value` to the `_to` address's balance.

2. **MUST fire the Transfer event**: The provided code correctly fires the `Transfer` event after updating the balances.

3. **The function SHOULD throw if the _from account has not authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism**: The provided code uses `require` to ensure that the `msg.sender` is authorized to spend at least `_value` tokens from the `_from` account.

4. **Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event**: The provided code does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value. However, since the code does not prevent 0 value transfers and will fire the `Transfer` event, it complies with this requirement.

5. **The function SHOULD throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend**: The provided code uses `require` to ensure that the `_from` account has enough balance to transfer `_value` tokens.

6. **Return Value**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that the function must return a boolean value indicating success. The provided code correctly returns `true` upon successful execution of the function.

7. **Use of SafeMath**: The provided code uses the `SafeMath` library for `sub` and `add` operations to prevent overflow and underflow, which is a good practice for security.

Based on the ERC-20 token standard and the provided code, there do not appear to be any violations in the `transferFrom` function or the related parts of the `Projecton` contract. The function correctly implements the required logic and checks as specified by the ERC-20 standard.

However, it's important to note that the provided code snippet does not include the entire contract, and there may be other aspects of the contract that are not compliant with the ERC-20 standard or that could introduce security vulnerabilities. A full audit would require reviewing the entire contract code, including other functions and state variables.
