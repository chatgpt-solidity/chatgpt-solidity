The provided Solidity function `approve` is intended to conform to the ERC-20 token standard, which is a common standard for implementing fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

Let's analyze the provided `approve` function against the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should:

1. Allow `_spender` to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
2. Overwrite the current allowance if the function is called again.
3. Return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.
4. Trigger the `Approval` event on a successful call.

The provided `approve` function appears to meet the first two requirements by setting the allowance in the `allowed` mapping and overwriting any existing allowance for the `_spender`.

However, there are a few issues with the provided `approve` function:

- The function signature does not include the `public` visibility specifier. In Solidity, functions are `public` by default, but it is considered good practice to explicitly state the visibility.
- The `Approval` event is being called without the `emit` keyword, which is required in Solidity versions 0.4.21 and above. The code provided does not specify the Solidity version, but the ERC mentions Solidity 0.4.17 or above, so it's important to use the correct syntax for the version being used.
- The `approve` function does not specify a return type. In Solidity, the return type should be specified after the parameter list with the `returns` keyword followed by the type in parentheses (e.g., `returns (bool success)`).
- The ERC-20 standard mentions that callers must handle false returns from `approve`, but the provided function does not have any conditions that would lead to a `false` return. This is not necessarily a violation, but it's important to note that the function will always return `true`, even if the approval does not make sense (e.g., approving an allowance for a zero address).

To improve compliance with the ERC-20 standard and Solidity best practices, the `approve` function should be modified as follows:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(_spender != address(0), "Cannot approve to the zero address");
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This revised function includes the `public` visibility specifier, uses the `emit` keyword for the event, checks for a non-zero `_spender` address, and explicitly states the return type.
