The provided Solidity code for the `JNTR` contract appears to be an implementation of an ERC20 token with some additional functionality. To determine if the constructor and related parts violate the given ERC (which is the ERC20 standard), we need to compare the provided code against the ERC20 specification.

From the ERC20 standard, the following functions and events are mandatory:

- `totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
- `balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`
- `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
- `allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)`
- `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
- `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

The provided code snippet includes the following relevant parts:

- The `totalSupply` is set in the contract's state variables.
- The `owner` is set to the address that deployed the contract.
- The `balances` mapping is initialized with the `totalSupply` for the `owner`.
- The `allowedIndex` and `allowedAddress` are additional state variables not specified in the ERC20 standard.

Based on the provided code snippet, we cannot see the implementation of the ERC20 functions (`balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`) or the ERC20 events (`Transfer`, `Approval`). However, the contract declaration indicates that it inherits from `ERC20`, which suggests that these functions and events might be implemented in the `ERC20` contract that `JNTR` is inheriting from.

The constructor itself does not violate the ERC20 standard as it initializes the state variables correctly. However, the additional state variables `allowedIndex` and `allowedAddress` and the `Account` struct are not part of the ERC20 standard. These additions do not inherently violate the standard, but their usage within the contract could potentially lead to non-compliance if they interfere with the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions.

To fully determine compliance with the ERC20 standard, the implementations of the inherited `ERC20` functions and the usage of the additional state variables would need to be reviewed. If the inherited functions follow the ERC20 specification and the additional state variables do not alter the expected behavior of an ERC20 token, then the contract would be compliant. If not, then the contract would violate the ERC20 standard.
