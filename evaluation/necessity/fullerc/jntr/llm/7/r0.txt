The provided Solidity code for the `approve` function and related parts of the `JNTR` contract appears to be an implementation of an ERC20 token with some additional logic. To determine whether the `approve` function violates the ERC20 standard, we need to compare the implementation with the ERC20 specification provided.

The ERC20 `approve` function specification states:

```
approve
Allows _spender to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the _value amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with _value. 
NOTE: To prevent attack vectors like the one described here and discussed here, clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before.
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```

The provided `approve` function in the `JNTR` contract does the following:

1. It calls `verifyTransaction` to ensure that both the sender and the spender are in the `allowedAddress` array and are active.
2. It requires that the `_value` to be approved is greater than 0.
3. It sets the allowance in the `allowed` mapping.
4. It emits the `Approval` event.

The ERC20 standard does not require the approval to be greater than 0, as it explicitly states that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event." This means that the ERC20 standard allows for the approval of 0 value, which can be used to reset allowances. The `require(_value > 0);` condition in the `JNTR` contract's `approve` function is therefore an additional constraint that is not part of the ERC20 standard and could be considered a violation of the standard.

Additionally, the ERC20 standard does not specify any conditions for verifying transactions between the sender and the spender, as implemented in the `verifyTransaction` function. This additional verification logic is not part of the ERC20 standard and could potentially restrict the usage of the `approve` function in ways that are not compliant with the standard.

In conclusion, the `approve` function in the `JNTR` contract does not fully comply with the ERC20 standard due to the additional requirement that the `_value` must be greater than 0 and the use of `verifyTransaction` to impose restrictions on who can be approved. These deviations from the standard could lead to compatibility issues with other contracts and services expecting strict adherence to the ERC20 specification.
