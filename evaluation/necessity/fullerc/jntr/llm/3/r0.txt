The `balanceOf` function provided in the Solidity code snippet appears to be compliant with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the ERC documentation you've provided. The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `balanceOf` function should:

- Accept an address `_owner` as a parameter.
- Return the balance of the `_owner` address.

The Solidity code for the `balanceOf` function does exactly that:

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
}
```

It takes an address `_owner` as an input and returns the balance associated with that address from the `balances` mapping. This is in line with the ERC-20 specification for the `balanceOf` function.

Additionally, the contract `JNTR` is declared to implement both `IST20` and `ERC20` interfaces. Without the full context of what `IST20` entails, it's not possible to determine if there are any conflicts or additional requirements that might affect ERC-20 compliance. However, based on the information provided, the `balanceOf` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard.

It's important to note that the ERC-20 standard also requires other functions and events to be implemented for full compliance, such as `transfer`, `approve`, `allowance`, `Transfer` event, and `Approval` event. These are not shown in the provided code snippet, so you would need to ensure that they are also implemented according to the standard in the rest of the contract code.
