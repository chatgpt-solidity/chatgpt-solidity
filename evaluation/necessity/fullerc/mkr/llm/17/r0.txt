The provided Solidity code defines a contract `DSToken` which inherits from `DSAuth`, `DSStop`, and `DSTokenBase`. The `DSTokenBase` contract, in turn, inherits from `ERC20` and `DSMath`. The `mint` function in the `DSToken` contract is designed to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address.

To determine if the `mint` function violates the ERC-20 standard, we need to compare its behavior with the ERC-20 specification provided.

The ERC-20 standard specifies the following for token creation:
- A `Transfer` event must be triggered when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.
- A token contract which creates new tokens should trigger a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

In the provided `mint` function, there is a call to `Mint(guy, wad);`, which suggests that there is a `Mint` event being emitted. However, according to the ERC-20 standard, the event that should be emitted is `Transfer`, with the `_from` address set to `0x0` to indicate token creation.

Here is a potential issue with the `mint` function:
- The `mint` function does not emit a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `0x0`. Instead, it emits a `Mint` event, which is not part of the ERC-20 standard.

To comply with the ERC-20 standard, the `mint` function should be modified to emit the `Transfer` event as specified. Here is a corrected version of the `mint` function:

```solidity
function mint(address guy, uint wad) public auth stoppable {
    _balances[guy] = add(_balances[guy], wad);
    _supply = add(_supply, wad);
    emit Transfer(address(0), guy, wad); // Emitting the correct Transfer event
}
```

Additionally, the ERC-20 standard requires the following functions and events to be implemented, which are not shown in the provided code snippet:
- `name()`
- `symbol()`
- `decimals()`
- `totalSupply()`
- `balanceOf(address _owner)`
- `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)`
- `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)`
- `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`
- `allowance(address _owner, address _spender)`
- `Approval` event

To fully assess compliance with the ERC-20 standard, the implementation of these functions and events would need to be reviewed as well. If any of these are missing or incorrectly implemented, the contract would not be fully ERC-20 compliant.
