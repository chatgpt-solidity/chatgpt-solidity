The provided Solidity code defines a contract `DSAuth` with a function `setOwner` that allows changing the owner of the contract. The `DSAuth` contract appears to be a generic authorization contract, not specifically an ERC20 token contract. It includes an `auth` modifier that checks if the message sender is authorized to call the function.

The provided ERC is the ERC20 standard, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable token transfers, allowances, and other token-related activities.

The `setOwner` function and the related parts of the `DSAuth` contract do not directly interact with the ERC20 standard. The ERC20 standard does not define ownership or authorization mechanisms for token contracts; it only specifies the token-related functions and events.

Therefore, the `setOwner` function and the related parts do not violate the ERC20 standard because they are not part of the ERC20 token functionality. The `DSAuth` contract could be used in conjunction with an ERC20 token contract to provide an additional layer of access control, but it is not part of the ERC20 standard itself.

In summary, the `setOwner` function does not pertain to the ERC20 standard and thus does not violate it. However, if `DSAuth` were used in an ERC20 token contract, it would be important to ensure that the authorization logic does not interfere with the standard ERC20 functions and their expected behaviors.
