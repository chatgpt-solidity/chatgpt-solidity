The provided Solidity code for the `approve` function and related parts of the smart contract seem to be compliant with the ERC-20 token standard, with one exception related to the `Approval` event.

Here's a breakdown of the compliance based on the ERC-20 specification:

1. The `approve` function allows a spender to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the value amount. If the function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with the new value, which is compliant with the ERC-20 standard.

2. The `approve` function in `DSTokenBase` emits the `Approval` event, which is required by the ERC-20 standard. However, there is a small issue with the event emission syntax. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `Approval` event should be emitted with the `indexed` keyword for the `_owner` and `_spender` parameters. The provided code does not include the `indexed` keyword, which is a minor deviation from the standard. The correct event emission should look like this:

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

3. The `DSToken` contract inherits from `DSStop`, which introduces a `stoppable` modifier. This modifier is used to prevent the `approve` function from being called when the contract is in a "stopped" state. This does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not specify the behavior of the `approve` function in the context of circuit breakers or pausing mechanisms. However, it is important to note that the use of such a mechanism should be clearly communicated to users, as it adds additional behavior not covered by the standard.

4. The `DSToken` contract's `approve` function correctly returns a boolean value, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard's requirement that callers must handle false from returns (bool success).

In summary, the provided code is mostly compliant with the ERC-20 standard, with the exception of the missing `indexed` keyword in the `Approval` event. This should be corrected to ensure full compliance with the standard and to enable better event filtering for clients subscribing to these events. Apart from this, the additional `stoppable` functionality does not violate the standard but should be well-documented for users of the token contract.
