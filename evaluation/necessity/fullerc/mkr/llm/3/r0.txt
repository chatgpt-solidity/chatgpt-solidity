The provided Solidity code defines a contract `DSAuth` that includes an authorization system with an owner and an authority. The `setAuthority` function allows the contract to change its authority to a new one, provided that the caller is authorized to make this change.

The provided ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) appears to be describing the ERC-20 token standard, which is a common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a token contract should implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These functions include `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`, as well as the events `Transfer` and `Approval`.

The `DSAuth` contract and the `setAuthority` function do not directly relate to the ERC-20 token standard. The `DSAuth` contract is an authorization control mechanism, and it does not implement any of the ERC-20 token functions or events. Therefore, the `setAuthority` function and the related parts of the `DSAuth` contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard because they serve a different purpose and are not part of the ERC-20 token functionality.

In summary, the `DSAuth` contract is not a token contract and does not need to comply with the ERC-20 standard. It is a separate contract that provides an authorization mechanism, which is not covered by the ERC-20 standard. As such, there is no violation of the ERC-20 standard in the provided code.
