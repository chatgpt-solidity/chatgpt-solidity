The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code does not fully comply with the ERC20 standard as described in the given ERC documentation. According to the ERC20 standard, the `approve` function should allow a spender to withdraw up to a certain amount from the caller's account multiple times. If the function is called again, it should overwrite the current allowance with the new value.

Here is the relevant part of the ERC20 standard for the `approve` function:

```
approve
Allows _spender to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the _value amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with _value.
```

However, in the provided Solidity code, the `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract is implemented to always set the allowance to the maximum possible value (`uint(-1)`) instead of a specific value provided by the caller:

```solidity
function approve(address guy) public stoppable returns (bool) {
    return super.approve(guy, uint(-1));
}
```

This implementation does not allow the caller to specify the allowance amount and always sets it to the maximum, which could lead to potential security risks and unexpected behavior. It does not follow the standard's guidance that the function should overwrite the current allowance with the value specified by the caller.

Additionally, the ERC20 standard mentions that clients should set the allowance to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender to prevent certain attack vectors. The provided code does not enforce this, which is correct as per the standard, but it also does not provide the functionality to set a specific allowance value at all, which is non-compliant.

Moreover, the `approve` function should emit an `Approval` event, but in the provided code, the event is emitted with the wrong capitalization (`Approval` instead of `approval`), which could lead to issues with event recognition:

```solidity
Approval(msg.sender, guy, wad);
```

The correct event emission should be:

```solidity
emit Approval(msg.sender, guy, wad);
```

In summary, the `approve` function in the provided Solidity code does not comply with the ERC20 standard because it does not allow setting a specific allowance value and always sets it to the maximum possible value. Additionally, there is a minor issue with the event emission capitalization.
