The provided Solidity code defines a set of contracts (`DSAuth`, `DSStop`, and `DSNote`) that implement an authorization mechanism (`DSAuth`), a stopping mechanism (`DSStop`), and an event logging mechanism (`DSNote`). These contracts are not directly related to the ERC-20 token standard, which is the ERC provided in your question.

The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to allow for the transfer of tokens, querying of token balances, and other token-related activities. The functions and events specified in the ERC-20 standard include `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, `Transfer`, and `Approval`.

The code you've provided does not implement any of the ERC-20 functions or events. Instead, it provides a set of utility contracts that could be used in conjunction with an ERC-20 token contract or any other contract that requires authorization and the ability to be stopped.

The `DSAuth` contract provides a mechanism to check if a caller is authorized to perform certain actions, and the `auth` modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions to authorized users only. The `DSStop` contract extends `DSAuth` and provides a mechanism to stop certain actions from being performed when the `stopped` variable is set to `true`. The `start` function allows an authorized user to set `stopped` to `false`, effectively "starting" the contract again. The `DSNote` contract provides a modifier `note` that logs an event every time a function with this modifier is called.

In conclusion, the provided code does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it is not an implementation of an ERC-20 token contract. It is a set of utility contracts that could be used by an ERC-20 token contract or any other smart contract. If these utility contracts were used within an ERC-20 token contract, it would be important to ensure that the token contract itself still complies with all the ERC-20 specifications, including implementing all the required functions and events.
