The provided Solidity code defines a token contract `DSToken` which inherits from `DSTokenBase` and `DSStop`. The `DSTokenBase` contract appears to implement the ERC20 interface, as it has mappings for `_balances` and `_approvals`, which are typical for an ERC20 token to track balances and allowances.

The `push` function in the `DSToken` contract is a convenience function that calls `transferFrom` to transfer tokens from the caller's address to another address. However, the `push` function does not return a boolean value as required by the ERC20 standard for the `transferFrom` function. According to the ERC20 standard, `transferFrom` should return a boolean value indicating success or failure, but the `push` function does not return anything.

Here's the relevant part of the ERC20 standard for `transferFrom`:

```solidity
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
```

The `push` function should be modified to return a boolean value to comply with the ERC20 standard. Here's how the `push` function could be modified:

```solidity
function push(address dst, uint wad) public returns (bool) {
    return transferFrom(msg.sender, dst, wad);
}
```

By adding the `returns (bool)` to the function signature and returning the result of `transferFrom`, the `push` function would now comply with the ERC20 standard.

Additionally, the `transferFrom` function in the `DSToken` contract should ensure that it complies with the ERC20 standard by checking for sufficient balance and allowance (unless the sender is the token holder themselves, in which case the allowance check is not necessary), and by emitting the `Transfer` event. The provided code does seem to handle these requirements, but without seeing the full implementation of the `DSTokenBase` and `DSStop` contracts, it's not possible to fully confirm compliance.

Lastly, the `DSMath` contract provides `add` and `sub` functions with overflow checks, which is good practice for arithmetic operations in Solidity to prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.

In summary, the `push` function violates the ERC20 standard by not returning a boolean value. The rest of the provided code appears to follow the ERC20 standard, but a full audit would require reviewing the entire contract code, including the implementation of the `DSTokenBase` and `DSStop` contracts.
