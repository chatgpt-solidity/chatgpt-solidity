The provided Solidity code defines a contract `DSToken` which inherits from `DSTokenBase` and `DSStop`. The `setName` function allows an authorized user to set the token's name. The `DSAuth` contract provides the authorization mechanism through the `auth` modifier, which checks if the message sender is authorized to call the function.

The ERC in question appears to be the ERC-20 standard, which is a widely accepted standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token should implement to ensure interoperability with other contracts and clients.

The `setName` function in the `DSToken` contract is not part of the ERC-20 standard. However, the ERC-20 standard does mention that the `name` function is optional and is used to improve usability. The standard specifies that the `name` function should return a string, but it does not enforce a specific mechanism for setting the token's name.

In the provided code, the `name` variable is of type `bytes32`, and the `setName` function allows changing this name. This does not violate the ERC-20 standard because the standard does not mandate how the name should be set or updated, only that there should be a function to retrieve the name as a string if it is implemented.

However, there are a few points to consider:

1. The ERC-20 standard suggests that the `name` function should return a string, not a `bytes32`. The contract should ideally include a function to return the name as a string to be fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard's optional `name` function.

2. The `setName` function is not part of the ERC-20 standard, so it is an additional feature. It does not violate the standard, but it is important to ensure that this function is properly secured so that only authorized users can call it. The `auth` modifier in the `DSAuth` contract seems to provide this security.

3. The `setName` function could potentially be used to change the token's name to something misleading or inappropriate. This is more of a governance concern than a technical one, but it's something that the token's developers and users should be aware of.

In conclusion, the `setName` function and related parts do not violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not specify how the name should be set, only that there should be a function to retrieve it. However, the contract should provide a way to return the name as a string to fully comply with the optional `name` function in the ERC-20 standard.
