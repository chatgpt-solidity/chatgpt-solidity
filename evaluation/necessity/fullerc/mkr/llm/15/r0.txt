To determine whether the `mint` function and related parts of the provided Solidity code violate the given ERC (which appears to be ERC-20 based on the description), we need to compare the code against the ERC-20 standard's specifications.

The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement. The `mint` function is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but it is a common practice in many token contracts to allow the creation of new tokens. However, the implementation of such a function must adhere to the ERC-20 standard's rules regarding state changes and event emissions.

Let's analyze the provided `mint` function:

```solidity
function mint(address guy, uint wad) public auth stoppable {
    _balances[guy] = add(_balances[guy], wad);
    _supply = add(_supply, wad);
    Mint(guy, wad);
}
```

The `mint` function increases the balance of the `guy` address by `wad` amount and also increases the total supply by the same amount. It also emits a `Mint` event. However, the ERC-20 standard requires that a `Transfer` event is emitted when tokens are created, with the `_from` address set to `0x0`. The provided code does not emit a `Transfer` event, which is a violation of the ERC-20 standard.

Additionally, the `mint` function is protected by the `auth` modifier, which restricts the function call to authorized users, and the `stoppable` modifier, which prevents the function from being called if the contract is stopped. These are not violations of the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not specify access control mechanisms for minting new tokens.

To make the `mint` function compliant with the ERC-20 standard, it should be modified to emit a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when new tokens are created. Here is an example of how the `mint` function could be modified:

```solidity
function mint(address guy, uint wad) public auth stoppable {
    _balances[guy] = add(_balances[guy], wad);
    _supply = add(_supply, wad);
    emit Transfer(address(0), guy, wad); // Emit a Transfer event with _from set to 0x0
}
```

In conclusion, the provided `mint` function violates the ERC-20 standard by not emitting a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created. The rest of the function's access control and pausability features are not in violation of the standard, as ERC-20 does not dictate these aspects of token contracts.
