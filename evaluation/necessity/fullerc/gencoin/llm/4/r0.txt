The `allowance` function provided in the Solidity code snippet appears to be compliant with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the ERC documentation you've provided. The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `allowance` function should:

- Return the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

The Solidity code for the `allowance` function does exactly that:

```solidity
function allowance(
    address _owner,
    address _spender
) constant returns (uint256 remaining) {
    return allowed[_owner][_spender];
}
```

It returns the remaining amount that `_spender` is allowed to withdraw from `_owner`'s account, which is stored in the `allowed` mapping.

However, there are a couple of points to note:

1. The `constant` keyword is used in the function declaration. In newer versions of Solidity (0.4.17 and above), the `view` or `pure` keyword is recommended to indicate that the function does not modify the state. The `constant` keyword is deprecated but should still work as expected for the purpose of this function.

2. The ERC-20 standard requires that the `allowance` function be marked as `public` and `view`. The code snippet does not explicitly mark the function as `public`, but in Solidity, functions are `public` by default if no visibility is specified. However, it would be better to explicitly state the visibility for clarity and to ensure that it aligns with the standard.

3. The ERC documentation mentions that callers must handle `false` from returns (`bool success`). However, this is not relevant to the `allowance` function, as it returns a `uint256` and not a `bool`. This note applies to functions like `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve`, which are expected to return a boolean value indicating success or failure.

In conclusion, the `allowance` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it would be best practice to update the function to use the `view` keyword and explicitly declare it as `public`:

```solidity
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining) {
    return allowed[_owner][_spender];
}
```

This would ensure full compliance with the ERC-20 standard and modern Solidity conventions.
