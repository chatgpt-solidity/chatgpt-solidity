The `approveAndCall` function in the provided Solidity code is not part of the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement, and `approveAndCall` is not one of them.

The ERC-20 standard includes the following functions and events:

- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`
- `transfer`
- `transferFrom`
- `approve`
- `allowance`
- `Transfer` event
- `Approval` event

The `approveAndCall` function is an extension to the ERC-20 standard that some contracts implement to allow a token holder to approve a transfer of their tokens to a third-party contract and then have that contract execute a function call with the approved tokens in a single transaction. This can be useful for certain types of interactions with smart contracts, but it is not required by the ERC-20 standard.

However, there are a few issues with the `approveAndCall` function as implemented in the provided code:

1. The `Approval` event should be emitted using the `emit` keyword, which was introduced in Solidity 0.4.21. The code provided does not use the `emit` keyword, which is a best practice for emitting events in newer versions of Solidity.

2. The `throw` statement is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity. Instead, `require`, `revert`, or `assert` should be used for error handling. In this case, `require` would be appropriate to revert the transaction if the call to `_spender` fails.

3. The `approveAndCall` function does not check whether the `_spender` is a contract or an externally owned account (EOA). If `_spender` is an EOA, the call to `_spender` with the `receiveApproval` function signature will fail because EOAs do not have code associated with them.

4. The `approveAndCall` function sets the allowance using `allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;` without first setting it to zero. This can potentially lead to a known race condition vulnerability described in the ERC-20 standard. The recommended practice is to first set the allowance to zero and then update it to the new value in two separate transactions to prevent this issue.

In conclusion, while the `approveAndCall` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard (since it is not part of the standard), it does not follow best practices for Solidity development and has potential security issues. It is also important to note that any extensions to the ERC-20 standard, such as `approveAndCall`, should be clearly documented and understood by users and developers interacting with the contract.
