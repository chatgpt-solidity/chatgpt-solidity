The provided Solidity code for the `totalSupply` function in the `Token` contract does not fully comply with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. Here are the issues:

1. The `totalSupply` function in the provided code does not specify the visibility of the function. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `totalSupply` function should be declared as `public`.

2. The `totalSupply` function in the provided code uses the `constant` keyword, which is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity. The ERC-20 standard specifies that the function should be marked as `view`, which indicates that the function does not modify the state of the contract.

3. The `totalSupply` function in the provided code does not have an implementation. The ERC-20 standard requires that this function returns the total token supply.

Here is how the `totalSupply` function should be declared according to the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256);
```

And a possible implementation could look like this:

```solidity
contract Token {
    uint256 private _totalSupply;

    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
        return _totalSupply;
    }

    // Other functions and contract code...
}
```

In this example, `_totalSupply` is a state variable that holds the total supply of the tokens, and the `totalSupply` function returns its value.

To fully comply with the ERC-20 standard, the `Token` contract should also implement the other functions and events specified in the ERC, such as `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, and the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.
