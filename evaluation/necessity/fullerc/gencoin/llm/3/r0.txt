The provided Solidity function `approve` from the `StandardToken` contract is intended to comply with the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 standard specifies the `approve` function as follows:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
```

The `approve` function allows `_spender` to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

The provided `approve` function in the `StandardToken` contract is:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This function sets the allowance in the `allowed` mapping and emits an `Approval` event, which is in line with the ERC20 standard. However, there are a few issues with the provided code:

1. The `approve` function does not have the `public` visibility specifier. In Solidity, functions are `public` by default, but it is considered good practice to explicitly state the visibility of functions.

2. The `approve` function does not specify the `returns` keyword with the `bool` type. It should be `returns (bool success)` to match the ERC20 standard.

3. The `Approval` event is emitted without being declared in the provided code snippet. The ERC20 standard requires that the `Approval` event be declared as follows:

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

4. The ERC20 standard mentions a known issue with the `approve` function related to the potential for a race condition. It suggests that clients should set the allowance to 0 before setting it to a new value for the same spender. The provided code does not enforce this, which is correct according to the standard, as it states "The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before."

5. The `approve` function does not have a check for the return value of false, as mentioned in the ERC20 standard notes. However, since the function always returns true, this is not an issue in this specific case.

In conclusion, the provided `approve` function mostly adheres to the ERC20 standard, but it should include the `public` visibility specifier and the correct `returns` keyword with the `bool` type to fully comply with the standard. Additionally, the `Approval` event should be declared in the contract, and while not required by the standard, it is recommended to consider the known race condition issue when designing the user interface or additional contract logic.
