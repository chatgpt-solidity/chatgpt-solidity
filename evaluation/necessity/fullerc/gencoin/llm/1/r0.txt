The provided `transferFrom` function in the Solidity code is intended to be part of an ERC20 token contract. To determine if the function complies with the ERC20 standard, we need to compare it against the `transferFrom` method specification in the ERC.

According to the ERC20 standard, the `transferFrom` method should:

1. Transfer `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`.
2. Fire the `Transfer` event.
3. Throw an error if the `_from` account has not authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
4. Treat transfers of 0 values as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

The provided Solidity code for `transferFrom` does the following:

- Checks if the `_from` account has enough balance (`balances[_from] >= _value`).
- Checks if the sender (`msg.sender`) is allowed to spend the specified amount on behalf of `_from` (`allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value`).
- Checks if the `_value` to be transferred is greater than 0 (`_value > 0`).
- If all conditions are met, it deducts the `_value` from the `_from` balance, adds it to the `_to` balance, updates the allowance, and emits the `Transfer` event.
- Returns `true` on success and `false` otherwise.

The code seems to be mostly compliant with the ERC20 standard, with one exception: the ERC20 standard states that the function should throw an error if the transfer cannot be made, whereas the provided code returns `false`. In Solidity, "throwing" typically means using `require` or `revert` to revert the transaction when a condition is not met, which also refunds any remaining gas to the caller.

The check for `_value > 0` is not necessary according to the ERC20 standard, as transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event. This line could potentially cause the function to not comply with the standard if it prevents zero-value transfers.

To make the `transferFrom` function fully compliant with the ERC20 standard, you could modify the code as follows:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balances[_from] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
    require(allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient allowance");
    // Note: The check for _value > 0 is removed to comply with the standard

    balances[_to] += _value;
    balances[_from] -= _value;
    allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value); // Updated to use 'emit' keyword for Solidity 0.4.21 or later
    return true;
}
```

Additionally, the `Transfer` event should be emitted using the `emit` keyword, which is a best practice in Solidity versions 0.4.21 and later.

In summary, the provided `transferFrom` function mostly follows the ERC20 standard, but it should be modified to throw errors instead of returning `false` and to allow zero-value transfers to fully comply with the standard.
