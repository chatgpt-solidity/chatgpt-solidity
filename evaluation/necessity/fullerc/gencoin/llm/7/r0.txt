The provided Solidity code for the `GEIMCOIN` contract includes a fallback function that is triggered when the contract receives Ether (ETH) without any other data. This function is intended to handle incoming ETH transactions and issue tokens in return, effectively creating a simple crowdsale mechanism.

Let's analyze the fallback function against the ERC-20 token standard:

1. **Transfer of Tokens**: The fallback function calculates the amount of tokens to issue based on the `msg.value` (amount of ETH sent) and `unitsOneEthCanBuy`. It then transfers this amount from the `fundsWallet` to the `msg.sender`. This is not a standard ERC-20 operation, as ERC-20 tokens are typically transferred using the `transfer` function, which requires explicit invocation.

2. **Transfer Event**: The function emits a `Transfer` event, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard. The standard requires that a `Transfer` event is emitted whenever tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

3. **Handling of Ether**: The ERC-20 standard does not specify behavior for receiving ETH, as it is a token standard, not a crowdsale standard. However, the fallback function's behavior of accepting ETH and issuing tokens is not prohibited by the ERC-20 standard, provided that the token accounting is done correctly.

4. **Return Value**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that functions like `transfer` should return a boolean value indicating success. The fallback function does not return any value, but since it is not a standard ERC-20 function, this is not a direct violation of the standard. However, it is important to note that the use of `require` statements will revert the transaction if the conditions are not met, which is a way to indicate failure.

5. **Approval and Allowance**: The fallback function does not interact with the `approve` and `allowance` mechanisms of the ERC-20 standard. It directly transfers tokens from the `fundsWallet` to the sender, assuming that the `fundsWallet` has enough tokens to cover the transfer. This bypasses the standard's intended use of `approve` and `allowance` for third-party transfers.

6. **Reentrancy Risk**: The function transfers ETH to the `fundsWallet` using `fundsWallet.transfer(msg.value)`. This could potentially introduce reentrancy risks if the `fundsWallet` is a contract with a fallback function. It is generally safer to perform all state changes before transferring ETH out of the contract.

In conclusion, the fallback function does not directly violate the ERC-20 standard, as it does not conflict with the specified functions and events. However, it implements additional functionality not covered by the standard, specifically the acceptance of ETH and issuance of tokens. This functionality should be clearly documented and understood by users of the contract. Additionally, the contract should be carefully reviewed for security considerations, such as reentrancy risks, and adherence to best practices for handling ETH transactions within contracts.
