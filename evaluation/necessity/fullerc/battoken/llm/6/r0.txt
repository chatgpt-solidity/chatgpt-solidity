The provided Solidity code for the `createTokens` function and related parts of the `BAToken` contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard as specified in the provided ERC documentation. However, there are some issues and points of non-compliance with best practices and the ERC-20 standard that should be addressed:

1. **Throw Statements**: The use of `throw` in Solidity is deprecated and should be replaced with `require` statements for conditional checks or `revert` for reverting the transaction. The `throw` keyword was used in older versions of Solidity, but it has been replaced to provide more clarity and control over error handling.

2. **Return Values**: The ERC-20 standard specifies that functions like `transfer` and `approve` should return a boolean value to indicate success or failure. The `createTokens` function does not return any value, but it is not part of the ERC-20 standard's required functions. However, it is a good practice to indicate the success or failure of functions that change the state.

3. **Transfer Event**: The ERC-20 standard requires that a `Transfer` event is emitted when tokens are transferred, including when new tokens are created. In the provided code, there is a `CreateBAT` event being emitted instead of the standard `Transfer` event. To comply with the ERC-20 standard, the contract should emit a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

4. **SafeMath Library**: The contract uses a `SafeMath` library for safe mathematical operations, which is a good practice to prevent overflows and underflows. However, the `assert` function is commented out and noted as no longer needed. It is important to ensure that the `SafeMath` functions are used consistently to prevent arithmetic errors.

5. **ERC-20 Required Functions**: The provided code does not include the implementation of all the required ERC-20 functions such as `transfer`, `approve`, `allowance`, and `transferFrom`. To be fully ERC-20 compliant, the contract must implement these functions according to the standard's specification.

6. **Optional ERC-20 Functions**: The ERC-20 standard specifies optional functions like `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`. These are not present in the provided code, but they are not strictly required for ERC-20 compliance. However, including them can improve the usability of the token.

In summary, while the `createTokens` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, the contract as a whole is not fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard due to the lack of required functions and events. Additionally, the use of deprecated Solidity patterns should be updated to align with current best practices.
