The provided `transferFrom` function in the Solidity code is intended to be part of an ERC20 token contract. ERC20 is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. To determine if the `transferFrom` function complies with the ERC20 standard, we need to compare its behavior with the specification outlined in the ERC provided.

Here's what the ERC20 standard specifies for the `transferFrom` function:

- Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
- The function SHOULD throw unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
- Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

Now, let's analyze the provided `transferFrom` function:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) returns (bool success) {
    if (
        balances[_from] >= _value &&
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value &&
        _value > 0
    ) {
        balances[_to] += _value;
        balances[_from] -= _value;
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

The function checks if the `_from` account has enough balance and if the `msg.sender` (the entity trying to perform the transfer) is authorized to spend the specified `_value` of tokens from `_from`'s account. If both conditions are met and `_value` is greater than 0, it performs the transfer, updates the balances, reduces the allowance, emits the `Transfer` event, and returns `true`.

However, there are a couple of issues with this implementation when compared to the ERC20 standard:

1. The function should throw an error if the transfer cannot be performed, but instead, it returns `false`. According to the ERC20 standard, the function SHOULD throw in case of failure. This is typically done using `require` statements in Solidity, which revert the transaction if a condition is not met.

2. The function checks if `_value > 0` before allowing the transfer. According to the ERC20 standard, transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event. The provided function does not allow transfers of 0 value and does not emit the `Transfer` event in such cases, which is a violation of the standard.

To comply with the ERC20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should be modified to throw an error when the transfer cannot be performed and to allow transfers of 0 value, emitting the `Transfer` event for them. Here is a revised version of the function that would comply with the standard:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balances[_from] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
    require(allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient allowance");
    balances[_to] += _value;
    balances[_from] -= _value;
    if (_value > 0) {
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
    }
    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

Note that in the revised version, the `require` statements are used to ensure that the function throws an error if the conditions are not met, and the `Transfer` event is emitted regardless of the `_value` being transferred. Additionally, the `emit` keyword is used for emitting events, which is the recommended syntax in newer versions of Solidity.
