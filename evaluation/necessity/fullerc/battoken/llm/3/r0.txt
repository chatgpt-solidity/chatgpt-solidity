The provided Solidity function `approve` from the `StandardToken` contract is intended to comply with the ERC-20 token standard, which is the standard interface for Ethereum tokens. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

The `approve` function in the ERC-20 standard allows a token holder to authorize another address (the spender) to transfer up to a specified number of tokens on their behalf. This is useful for enabling other contracts to interact with the tokens, such as when using a decentralized exchange.

Here is the relevant part of the ERC-20 standard for the `approve` function:

```
approve
Allows _spender to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the _value amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with _value. 
NOTE: To prevent attack vectors like the one described here and discussed here, clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before.
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```

The provided `approve` function in the `StandardToken` contract does the following:

1. Sets the allowance for the `_spender` to `_value` for the `msg.sender`.
2. Emits an `Approval` event with the `msg.sender`, `_spender`, and `_value`.

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This implementation is compliant with the ERC-20 standard. However, there is a known issue with the `approve` function that can lead to a potential race condition. If a user wants to change the allowance for a spender, they should first set the allowance to zero and then set it to the new value. This is because the spender could spend the old allowance and then the new one if they are quick enough when the allowances are being changed.

The ERC-20 standard mentions this issue and suggests that clients (user interfaces) should enforce setting the allowance to zero before setting it to a new value for the same spender. However, it explicitly states that the contract itself should not enforce this to maintain backward compatibility with contracts deployed before this issue was known.

The provided `approve` function does not enforce setting the allowance to zero before setting a new value, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard's recommendation for backward compatibility. Therefore, the `approve` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard.

However, it is important to note that the `approve` function does not include the `public` visibility specifier and does not explicitly return a `bool` type, which are both part of the ERC-20 standard's function signature for `approve`. To be fully compliant, the function should be declared as follows:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    // Function body remains the same
}
```

Additionally, the `Approval` event should be declared in the contract with the `event` keyword and should match the ERC-20 standard's event signature:

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

Assuming that the `Approval` event is declared correctly elsewhere in the contract, the only changes needed for full compliance are the visibility specifier and the explicit return type for the `approve` function.
