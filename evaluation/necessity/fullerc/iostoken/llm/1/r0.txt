The provided Solidity function `transfer` is intended to be part of an ERC-20 token contract, as it is a common method within the ERC-20 standard. To determine if the function complies with the ERC-20 standard, we need to compare it against the ERC-20 specification provided.

Here's a breakdown of the `transfer` function requirements according to the ERC-20 standard and how the provided function stacks up:

1. **Transfers _value amount of tokens to address _to**: The provided function does indeed attempt to transfer `_value` tokens to the address `_to`.

2. **MUST fire the Transfer event**: The provided function does fire the `Transfer` event, which is correct.

3. **The function SHOULD throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend**: The provided function checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to `_value`, which is correct. However, the function returns `false` instead of throwing an error if the sender does not have enough tokens. According to the ERC-20 standard, the function should throw an error to revert all changes in the case of insufficient balance.

4. **Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event**: The provided function does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value, but since it does not prevent it and would fire the `Transfer` event, it complies with this requirement.

5. **Return Value**: The function must return a boolean value indicating success. The provided function does return a boolean, which is correct.

6. **SafeMath**: The ERC-20 standard does not explicitly mention the use of SafeMath or underflow/overflow checks, but it is a best practice to prevent such issues. The provided function does check for overflow when adding to `balances[_to]`, which is good practice.

Based on the ERC-20 standard and the provided function, the main issue with the `transfer` function is that it returns `false` instead of throwing an error when the sender does not have enough tokens. According to the ERC-20 standard, the function should throw an error in this case to revert the transaction.

To comply with the ERC-20 standard, the function should be modified to use a `require` statement to ensure that the sender has enough tokens, which would automatically revert the transaction if the condition is not met. Here's an example of how the function could be modified:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
    require(balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to], "Transfer overflow");

    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

Note that in Solidity 0.4.21 and later, the `emit` keyword is used when firing events, so `Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);` should be `emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);` to follow the latest syntax, although this is not a requirement of the ERC-20 standard itself.
