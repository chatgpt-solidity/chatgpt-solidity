The provided Solidity event interfaces are:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
```

These events are part of the ERC-20 token standard, which is the standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of API methods and events that a compliant token contract must implement.

According to the ERC-20 standard provided, the events should be declared as follows:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
```

Comparing the provided event interfaces with the ERC-20 standard, we can see that they match the required format exactly. Both `Transfer` and `Approval` events have the correct parameters and use the `indexed` keyword for the addresses, which is necessary for the events to be filterable by these parameters.

Therefore, the provided event interfaces do not violate the ERC-20 standard. They are correctly formatted and comply with the ERC-20 event specifications.
