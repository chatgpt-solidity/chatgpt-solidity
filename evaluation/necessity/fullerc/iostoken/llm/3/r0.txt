The provided Solidity function `approve` in the `RegularToken` contract is intended to comply with the ERC-20 token standard, which is the standard interface for Ethereum tokens. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

The `approve` function in the ERC-20 standard allows a token holder to authorize another address (the spender) to transfer up to a specified number of tokens on their behalf. This is useful for enabling other contracts to interact with the tokens, such as when using a decentralized exchange.

The provided `approve` function looks like this:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should:

1. Allow `_spender` to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
2. Overwrite the current allowance with `_value` if the function is called again.
3. Return a boolean value indicating success.
4. Trigger the `Approval` event on a successful call.

The provided `approve` function meets the first three requirements. However, there are a couple of issues with the implementation:

1. The `approve` function does not specify the visibility (e.g., `public`), which is required in Solidity for functions that should be callable externally. This is a minor issue and can be fixed by adding the `public` keyword to the function signature.

2. The `Approval` event is emitted without the `emit` keyword, which is required in Solidity versions 0.4.21 and later. The correct way to emit an event is as follows:

```solidity
emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
```

3. The ERC-20 standard mentions a known issue related to the `approve` function, where clients should set the allowance to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender to prevent certain attack vectors. While the contract itself should not enforce this (to maintain backward compatibility), it is worth noting that the provided function does not include any checks or comments regarding this potential issue.

4. The function does not have a return type specified. In Solidity, the return type should be explicitly stated, like `returns (bool success)`. This is important for callers to handle the return value correctly.

5. The function does not have the `event Approval` declaration within the contract code provided. It is assumed that this event is declared elsewhere in the contract, as it is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard.

In conclusion, the provided `approve` function mostly complies with the ERC-20 standard, but it has some minor issues related to Solidity syntax and best practices. These issues should be addressed to ensure full compliance with the standard and to avoid potential problems when interacting with other contracts and services on the Ethereum network.
