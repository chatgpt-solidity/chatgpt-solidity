The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and the related parts from the `CMBToken` contract are intended to implement the ERC20 token standard. Let's compare the provided code against the ERC20 specification to see if there are any violations:

1. **Transfer Function Requirements**: According to the ERC20 standard, the `transfer` function should:
   - Transfer `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`.
   - Fire the `Transfer` event.
   - Throw if the sender's balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
   - Treat transfers of 0 values as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

2. **Transfer Function Implementation**: The provided `transfer` function in the `CMBToken` contract:
   - Checks if the sender's balance is sufficient and that the `_value` is greater than 0.
   - Subtracts `_value` from the sender's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance using the `SafeMath` library functions `sub` and `add`.
   - Fires the `Transfer` event.
   - Returns `true` on success.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The `transfer` function should allow transfers of 0 values and still fire the `Transfer` event. However, the provided code has a `require` statement that prevents transfers of 0 values (`_value > 0`). This is a violation of the ERC20 standard.
   - The `Transfer` event should be emitted with the correct signature. In Solidity 0.4.17 or above, the event should be declared with the `event` keyword and should be emitted using the `emit` keyword. The provided code does not show the event declaration, and it uses the event name directly without the `emit` keyword, which is an outdated practice and may not compile with newer Solidity versions.
   - The `transfer` function does not specify the visibility (e.g., `public` or `external`). In Solidity, functions are `public` by default, but it is good practice to explicitly state the visibility for clarity and to prevent potential issues with future changes to the language.
   - The `transfer` function does not specify the `returns` keyword with the return type. It should be `returns (bool success)` to match the ERC20 specification.

4. **SafeMath Library**:
   - The `SafeMath` library functions `add` and `sub` are used correctly to prevent overflow and underflow, which is a good practice for security.
   - However, the `SafeMath` functions should be marked as `pure` instead of `internal` because they do not modify the contract's state.

In conclusion, the provided `transfer` function violates the ERC20 standard by not allowing transfers of 0 values. Additionally, there are some best practices and minor issues that should be addressed to ensure the contract is up to date with the latest Solidity standards and conventions.
