The Solidity event interfaces provided in the code snippet are:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
event Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);
```

These events are part of the ERC-20 token standard, which is the standard interface for tokens mentioned in the ERC provided. The ERC-20 standard specifies two events:

1. `Transfer`: MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.
2. `Approval`: MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

The event signatures in the code snippet match the ERC-20 standard's event specifications:

- The `Transfer` event has three parameters: `_from` (indexed), `_to` (indexed), and `_value`. The code snippet has the same parameters, although the parameter names are omitted, which is allowed in Solidity as long as the types and indexed status match.
- The `Approval` event also has three parameters: `_owner` (indexed), `_spender` (indexed), and `_value`. The code snippet matches this specification as well.

Therefore, based on the event interfaces provided in the code snippet, there is no violation of the ERC-20 standard. However, it is important to note that compliance with the ERC-20 standard is not solely determined by event definitions. The contract must also implement the specified functions correctly and adhere to the behavior described in the ERC-20 standard, such as handling token transfers, approvals, and allowances as specified. Without the full contract code, we cannot determine full compliance, but the events themselves are correctly defined according to the ERC-20 standard.
