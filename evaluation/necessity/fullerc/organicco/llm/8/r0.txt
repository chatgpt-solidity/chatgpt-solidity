The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and related parts of the smart contract need to be evaluated against the ERC-20 token standard to determine if there are any violations. Let's go through the ERC-20 specification and compare it with the provided code.

ERC-20 `transferFrom` Specification:
- Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
- The function SHOULD throw if the `_from` account has not authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
- Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

Now, let's analyze the provided `transferFrom` function:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint _value
) public returns (bool) {
    if (
        _allowances[_from][msg.sender] > 0 &&
        _value > 0 &&
        _allowances[_from][msg.sender] >= _value &&
        _balanceOf[_from] >= _value
    ) {
        _balanceOf[_from] = _balanceOf[_from].sub(_value);
        _balanceOf[_to] = _balanceOf[_to].add(_value);
        _allowances[_from][msg.sender] = _allowances[_from][msg.sender].sub(
            _value
        );
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

Upon reviewing the code, we can identify the following issues in relation to the ERC-20 standard:

1. The function should throw an error if the transfer cannot be performed, but instead, it returns `false`. According to the ERC-20 standard, the function SHOULD throw if the conditions for the transfer are not met. This can be done by using `require` statements instead of `if` statements to ensure that the function reverts on failure.

2. The function does not allow for transfers of 0 values. The ERC-20 standard states that transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event. The code provided has a condition `_value > 0` which prevents 0 value transfers.

3. The `Transfer` event is not correctly defined. In Solidity, events should be emitted using the `emit` keyword, which is missing in the provided code. The correct syntax should be `emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);`.

To comply with the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should be modified as follows:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint _value
) public returns (bool) {
    require(_allowances[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Allowance is not enough");
    require(_balanceOf[_from] >= _value, "Balance is not enough");

    _balanceOf[_from] = _balanceOf[_from].sub(_value);
    _balanceOf[_to] = _balanceOf[_to].add(_value);
    _allowances[_from][msg.sender] = _allowances[_from][msg.sender].sub(_value);
    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This revised function uses `require` to ensure that the function reverts if the conditions are not met, allows for 0 value transfers, and correctly emits the `Transfer` event.
