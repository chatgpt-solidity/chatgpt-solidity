The function provided in the Solidity code snippet is intended to return the name of the token:

```solidity
contract Token {
    string internal _name;

    function name() public constant returns (string) {
        return _name;
    }
}
```

According to the ERC (which appears to be ERC-20 based on the provided methods and events), the `name` function is specified as follows:

```solidity
function name() public view returns (string)
```

The ERC-20 token standard specifies that the `name` function is optional and should be a `public view` function that returns a string. The function in the provided Solidity code snippet is marked as `public constant`, which is equivalent to `public view` in Solidity (the `constant` keyword is used in older versions of Solidity to indicate that the function does not modify the state and can be executed locally/off-chain).

However, there is a slight discrepancy in the function signature. The ERC-20 standard does not specify the return type of the `name` function as `string memory` or `string storage`, but Solidity 0.4.17 and later versions require specifying the data location for complex types like strings when they are returned from a function. The correct declaration in newer versions of Solidity should include the data location, like so:

```solidity
function name() public view returns (string memory) {
    return _name;
}
```

The provided code does not specify the data location (`memory` or `storage`), which might be because it is written in an older version of Solidity (prior to 0.5.0, where specifying the data location for return values was not required). If the contract is intended to be compiled with Solidity 0.5.0 or later, the function should be updated to include the data location.

In conclusion, the function `name` does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it may need to be updated to include the data location if it is to be compiled with a newer version of Solidity. The rest of the contract code and its compliance with the ERC-20 standard cannot be determined from the snippet provided, as the full implementation of all required functions and events is not shown.
