The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code for the `Organicco` contract does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard as described in the given ERC documentation. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should set the allowance for a spender to a certain value, overwriting the current allowance with the new value.

Here is the relevant part of the ERC-20 standard for the `approve` function:

> Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

However, the `approve` function in the `Organicco` contract is implemented as follows:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    _allowances[msg.sender][_spender] = _allowances[msg.sender][_spender].add(_value);
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This implementation incorrectly adds the new value (`_value`) to the current allowance instead of setting the allowance to `_value`. This means that if a user calls `approve` multiple times, it will keep increasing the allowance rather than setting it to the specific value provided in the latest call.

To comply with the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should be modified to set the allowance to `_value` directly, like this:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    _allowances[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

Additionally, the `Approval` event should be emitted using the `emit` keyword, which is the current best practice in Solidity (though the code provided may be using an older version of Solidity where `emit` was not required).

It's also worth noting that the ERC-20 standard mentions a known issue with the `approve` function that can lead to race conditions. It suggests that user interfaces should set the allowance to 0 before setting it to a new value for the same spender. However, this is not enforced in the contract code itself to maintain backward compatibility with contracts deployed before this issue was known.

In summary, the `approve` function in the provided `Organicco` contract code does not comply with the ERC-20 standard and should be corrected to overwrite the current allowance with the new value provided in the function call.
