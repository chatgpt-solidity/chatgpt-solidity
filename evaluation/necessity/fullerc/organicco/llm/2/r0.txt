The provided Solidity function `decimals` and the related parts from the smart contract do not violate the given ERC, which in this case is the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies an optional `decimals` function that should return the number of decimals the token uses. This is used to determine how the token's value can be displayed to users. For example, if a token has 18 decimals, the token's smallest unit (1 Wei) is 0.000000000000000001 tokens.

The ERC-20 standard specifies the `decimals` function as follows:

```solidity
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```

The provided Solidity code for the `decimals` function is:

```solidity
contract Token {
    uint8 internal _decimals;

    function decimals() public constant returns (uint8) {
        return _decimals;
    }
}
```

This implementation is compliant with the ERC-20 standard. The function is marked as `public`, which means it can be called by external users and contracts. It returns a `uint8` value, which is the correct return type for the `decimals` function as per the ERC-20 standard.

However, there is a minor discrepancy in the use of the `constant` keyword. In the ERC-20 standard, the `view` keyword is used, which indicates that the function does not modify the state of the contract. The `constant` keyword was used in older versions of Solidity and has the same effect as `view` in this context. It is recommended to use `view` for newer Solidity versions to be consistent with the current language specification and best practices.

To fully comply with the latest Solidity standards and best practices, the function should be updated to use the `view` keyword instead of `constant`:

```solidity
function decimals() public view returns (uint8) {
    return _decimals;
}
```

Other than this minor point about the `constant` keyword, the provided function does not violate the ERC-20 standard and correctly implements the optional `decimals` function.
