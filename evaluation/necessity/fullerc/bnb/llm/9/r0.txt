The provided Solidity function interfaces are meant to be compared against the ERC-20 token standard, which is the most common standard for Ethereum tokens. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a compliant token should implement.

Let's compare the provided function interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

1. `BNB(uint256,string,uint8,string) returns()` - This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard and seems to be a constructor or an initialization function for a token with additional parameters.

2. `transfer(address,uint256) returns()` - The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `transfer` function should return a boolean value indicating success or failure. The provided interface does not return any value, which violates the ERC-20 standard.

3. `approve(address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

4. `transferFrom(address,address,uint256) returns(bool)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

5. `burn(uint256) returns(bool)` - This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It is often included in token contracts to allow tokens to be "burned" or permanently removed from circulation, but it is not required by ERC-20.

6. `freeze(uint256) returns(bool)` - This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard. It seems to be related to freezing tokens, which is not a requirement of ERC-20.

7. `unfreeze(uint256) returns(bool)` - Similar to `freeze`, this is not part of the ERC-20 standard.

8. `withdrawEther(uint256) returns()` - This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard and is likely related to withdrawing Ether from the contract, which is not a requirement of ERC-20.

9. `fallback() returns()` - The fallback function is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but it is a common function in Solidity contracts to handle Ether sent to the contract.

10. `name() returns(string)` - This is optional in ERC-20 and matches the standard.

11. `decimals() returns(uint8)` - This is optional in ERC-20 and matches the standard.

12. `balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

13. `symbol() returns(string)` - This is optional in ERC-20 and matches the standard.

14. `freezeOf(address) returns(uint256)` - This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard.

15. `owner() returns(address)` - This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard and is likely related to contract ownership, which is not a requirement of ERC-20.

16. `allowance(address,address) returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

17. `totalSupply() returns(uint256)` - This matches the ERC-20 standard.

In summary, the provided Solidity function interfaces violate the ERC-20 standard in the following ways:

- The `transfer` function does not return a boolean value.
- There are additional non-standard functions (`BNB`, `burn`, `freeze`, `unfreeze`, `withdrawEther`, `fallback`, `freezeOf`, `owner`) that are not required by the ERC-20 standard. While these do not necessarily violate the standard, they are not part of it.
- The `transfer` function should return a boolean value to indicate success or failure, as per the ERC-20 standard.

To be fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard, the contract should ensure that all required functions return the correct types as specified, and while additional functions can be included, they do not form part of the ERC-20 specification.
