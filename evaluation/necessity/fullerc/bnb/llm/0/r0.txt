The provided Solidity code for the `BNB` contract appears to be an attempt to implement an ERC20 token, given the context of the variables and the initial setup in the constructor. However, the code snippet provided is incomplete and does not show the full implementation of the ERC20 standard. To determine if the `BNB` contract violates the ERC20 standard, we need to check for the presence and correct implementation of the following methods and events as specified in the ERC:

1. `function name() public view returns (string)`
2. `function symbol() public view returns (string)`
3. `function decimals() public view returns (uint8)`
4. `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
5. `function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)`
6. `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
7. `function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
8. `function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
9. `function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)`
10. `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)`
11. `event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)`

From the provided code snippet, we can see that the contract has the following ERC20-related properties:

- `name`
- `symbol`
- `decimals`
- `totalSupply`
- `balanceOf`

However, the code snippet does not include any of the ERC20 functions (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`) or events (`Transfer`, `Approval`). Without these functions and events, the contract does not comply with the ERC20 standard.

Additionally, the constructor is named `BNB`, which is the old way of defining a constructor in Solidity. In Solidity versions 0.4.22 and later, constructors are defined using the `constructor` keyword rather than a function with the same name as the contract. This could lead to issues if the contract is compiled with a newer version of the Solidity compiler.

To be compliant with the ERC20 standard, the `BNB` contract must implement all the required functions and events. It is also recommended to follow the latest Solidity practices, such as using the `constructor` keyword for the constructor and ensuring that the contract is safe against reentrancy attacks and other common vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, based on the provided code snippet, the `BNB` contract does not fully implement the ERC20 standard and would be considered non-compliant. The full contract code would need to be reviewed to make a comprehensive assessment.
