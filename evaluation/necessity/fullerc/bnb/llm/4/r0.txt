The provided Solidity code for the `burn` function and related parts of the `BNB` contract do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard, as the ERC-20 standard does not specify a `burn` function. However, there are some issues with the code that are worth mentioning:

1. The use of `throw` is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity. Instead, `require` should be used for input validation, and `revert` should be used for error handling. The `throw` keyword has been replaced with `revert()`, `require()`, and `assert()` in Solidity 0.4.13 and later. The `throw` keyword consumes all remaining gas, while `revert()` allows unused gas to be refunded.

2. The `burn` function should emit a `Transfer` event with the `_to` address set to the zero address (`0x0`) to indicate that tokens are being destroyed. This is a common practice to ensure transparency in token transactions, including token destruction, and is recommended by the ERC-20 standard for the creation of new tokens. It is equally important for the destruction of tokens to maintain a clear audit trail of token supply changes.

3. The `burn` function does not have a visibility specifier (e.g., `public` or `external`). It is best practice to explicitly state the visibility of functions.

4. The `burn` function does not have the `SafeMath` library used in a consistent way. The `SafeMath` library is typically used with the `using SafeMath for uint256;` declaration, which allows the syntax `balanceOf[msg.sender].sub(_value)` instead of `SafeMath.safeSub(balanceOf[msg.sender], _value)`.

5. The `burn` function is missing the `event Burn(address indexed _from, uint256 _value);` declaration that is necessary for the `Burn(msg.sender, _value);` line to work correctly.

6. The `burn` function should return `bool` but does not specify the `returns` keyword in the function declaration.

Here is a revised version of the `burn` function that addresses these issues:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24; // or a more recent version

import "./SafeMath.sol";

contract BNB {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
    event Burn(address indexed _from, uint256 _value);

    function burn(uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
        require(_value > 0, "Value must be greater than 0");

        balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender].sub(_value);
        totalSupply = totalSupply.sub(_value);
        emit Burn(msg.sender, _value);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), _value);

        return true;
    }
}
```

In this revised version, `throw` has been replaced with `require`, the `Transfer` event is emitted with the zero address to indicate token burning, and the `SafeMath` library is used with the `using` declaration for cleaner syntax. Additionally, the `Burn` event is declared, and the function visibility is set to `public`.
