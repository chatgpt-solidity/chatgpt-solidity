The provided Solidity code for the `withdrawEther` function and the related parts from the smart contract do not directly relate to the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard is a specification for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a set of rules for token transfers, allowances, and other token-related activities.

The `withdrawEther` function in the provided contract appears to be a mechanism for the contract owner to withdraw Ether (the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) from the contract. This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard, which deals with token operations rather than Ether transactions.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. The ERC-20 standard specifies functions and events related to the transfer and management of token balances. It does not cover the withdrawal of Ether from a contract.

2. The `withdrawEther` function uses a `throw` statement for access control, which is an outdated practice in Solidity. The `throw` statement has been deprecated and replaced with `require`, `revert`, and `assert` functions for error handling and condition checking.

3. The `withdrawEther` function does not emit any events. While this is not an issue with respect to the ERC-20 standard, it is generally a good practice to emit events for significant state changes in a contract, such as the withdrawal of funds.

4. The `withdrawEther` function does not check for the success of the `transfer` operation. In Solidity, it is recommended to check the return value of the `transfer` function or use the `transfer` function's low-level counterpart `call` with `.value(amount)("")` and check for success to prevent issues with sending Ether to contracts.

5. The contract inherits from `SafeMath`, but the `withdrawEther` function does not use any SafeMath operations. This is not an issue with respect to the ERC-20 standard, but it is worth noting that SafeMath is used to prevent overflow and underflow issues in arithmetic operations.

In conclusion, the `withdrawEther` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard because it is not related to the token functionality specified by the standard. However, the function does have some issues with outdated syntax and lack of best practices in error handling and event emission. It is important to update the contract to align with current Solidity standards and best practices for security and maintainability.
