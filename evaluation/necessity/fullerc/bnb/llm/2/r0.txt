The provided Solidity function `approve` from the `BNB` contract is intended to comply with the ERC-20 token standard, which is a common standard for implementing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

Let's analyze the provided `approve` function against the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (_value <= 0) throw;
    allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    return true;
}
```

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should allow `_spender` to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

The provided `approve` function does set the allowance correctly. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Use of `throw`**: The use of `throw` for error handling is outdated and consumes all remaining gas. The current best practice is to use `require` statements for input validation, which provides the same functionality but with a gas refund for any unused gas.

2. **Return Type**: The function signature does not specify the visibility (e.g., `public`) and does not include the `view` or `pure` specifier where applicable. In Solidity 0.4.17 and above, it is recommended to specify the visibility of functions.

3. **Event Emission**: The ERC-20 standard requires that the `Approval` event must be triggered on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`. The provided function does not emit the `Approval` event, which is a violation of the standard.

4. **Zero Value Allowance**: The ERC-20 standard does not explicitly forbid setting an allowance to zero. In fact, it is a common security practice to first set the allowance to zero before setting it to a new value to prevent the "approval race condition" attack. The provided function throws an error if `_value` is less than or equal to zero, which is not in line with the standard and could lead to issues with interoperability and user interfaces that expect to be able to set allowances to zero.

To make the `approve` function compliant with the ERC-20 standard, the following changes should be made:

- Replace `throw` with `require(_value > 0, "Value must be greater than zero");` or remove the check entirely to allow setting the allowance to zero.
- Specify the visibility of the function (e.g., `public`).
- Emit the `Approval` event after setting the allowance.

Here is an updated version of the `approve` function that addresses these issues:

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);

function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    // Optional: require(_value > 0, "Value must be greater than zero");
    allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This updated function is more in line with the ERC-20 standard and should not violate any of its specifications.
