The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is intended to transfer tokens from one address to another on behalf of the token holder, given that the sender has been authorized to spend a certain amount of tokens from the token holder's account. This is a common functionality in ERC-20 tokens.

Let's analyze the provided `transferFrom` function against the ERC-20 standard:

1. **Zero Address Check**: The function correctly checks for transfers to the `0x0` address and throws an error, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard to prevent transfers to the zero address.

2. **Value Check**: The function checks if the `_value` is less than or equal to zero and throws an error. However, according to the ERC-20 standard, transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event. This is a violation of the ERC-20 standard.

3. **Balance Check**: The function checks if the sender has enough balance and throws an error if not, which is correct according to the ERC-20 standard.

4. **Overflow Check**: The function checks for overflows when adding the `_value` to the recipient's balance, which is good practice to prevent overflows.

5. **Allowance Check**: The function checks if the `_value` is greater than the allowance and throws an error if it is, which is correct according to the ERC-20 standard.

6. **Updating Balances and Allowance**: The function correctly subtracts the `_value` from the sender's balance and the allowance, and adds the `_value` to the recipient's balance using safe math operations.

7. **Transfer Event**: The function should emit a `Transfer` event after a successful transfer. However, the code provided does not include the declaration of the `Transfer` event, which is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard. This is a violation if the event is not declared elsewhere in the contract.

8. **Return Value**: The function should return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation. The provided function does return a boolean value, which is correct according to the ERC-20 standard.

9. **Use of `throw`**: The use of `throw` for error handling is outdated and consumes all remaining gas. The recommended practice is to use `require` for precondition checks, which provides the same functionality but with gas refunds for unused gas. This is not a direct violation of the ERC-20 standard, but it is not in line with current best practices.

10. **SafeMath Usage**: The contract uses a custom `SafeMath` library for safe arithmetic operations, which is good practice to prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows.

In summary, the `transferFrom` function violates the ERC-20 standard in the following ways:

- It disallows transfers of 0 value by throwing an error, which is against the standard.
- The `Transfer` event declaration is not included in the provided code, which is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard (assuming it's not declared elsewhere in the contract).

Additionally, the use of `throw` for error handling is outdated and should be replaced with `require` statements. The rest of the function's logic appears to comply with the ERC-20 standard.
