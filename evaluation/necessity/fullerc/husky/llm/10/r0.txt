The `allowance` function provided in the Solidity code snippet for the `SiberianHusky` contract appears to be compliant with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `allowance` function should:

> Returns the amount which _spender is still allowed to withdraw from _owner.

The Solidity code for the `allowance` function does exactly that:

```solidity
function allowance(
    address owner,
    address spender
) public view override returns (uint256) {
    return _allowances[owner][spender];
}
```

It is a public view function that takes an `owner` and a `spender` address as arguments and returns the remaining amount that the `spender` is allowed to withdraw from the `owner`'s balance. This is in line with the ERC-20 standard's specification for the `allowance` function.

Additionally, the function is marked as `override`, which suggests that it is overriding a function defined in an interface or a parent contract (`IERC20` in this case), which is expected for ERC-20 compliant tokens that implement the `IERC20` interface.

There is no indication in the provided code snippet that the `allowance` function violates the ERC-20 standard. However, it is important to note that a full audit would require reviewing the entire contract, including how allowances are set (typically via the `approve` function) and how they are used (typically via the `transferFrom` function), as well as ensuring that the contract correctly implements all other functions and events required by the ERC-20 standard.
