The provided Solidity function `symbol` within the `SiberianHusky` contract appears to be compliant with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `symbol` function is an optional method that returns the symbol of the token, and it is implemented as a public view function returning a string, which matches the ERC-20 specification.

Here is the relevant part of the ERC-20 standard for the `symbol` function:

```
symbol
Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX". OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```

The `SiberianHusky` contract's `symbol` function is defined as follows:

```solidity
function symbol() public view returns (string memory) {
    return _symbol;
}
```

This function correctly returns the symbol of the token as a string, and it is marked as `public` and `view`, which means it does not modify the state and can be called externally to read the `_symbol` value.

Therefore, the `symbol` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard. It is important to note that the ERC-20 standard does not enforce a specific symbol format or length; it only requires that the function returns a string representing the token's symbol. The actual symbol "SHUSKY" is a design choice by the contract creators and is not governed by the ERC-20 standard.

However, it is worth mentioning that the ERC-20 standard has evolved, and there are now recommendations for additional checks and safety measures in token contracts, such as preventing reentrancy attacks and ensuring safe math operations. These are not directly related to the `symbol` function but are important considerations for the overall security and robustness of an ERC-20 token contract. It is recommended to use well-reviewed and audited implementations, such as those provided by OpenZeppelin, to ensure compliance with best practices beyond the basic ERC-20 standard.
