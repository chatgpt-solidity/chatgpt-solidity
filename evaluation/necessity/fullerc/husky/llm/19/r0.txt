The provided Solidity code for the `SiberianHusky` contract appears to implement a token with reflection mechanics, which is not a standard feature of the ERC-20 token standard. The `reflect` function allows users to reduce their balance and the total reflected balance (`_rTotal`) while increasing the total fees (`_tFeeTotal`).

The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement. These include `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`, along with the `Transfer` and `Approval` events. The standard also outlines the expected behavior of these functions and events.

The `reflect` function in the `SiberianHusky` contract does not conform to the ERC-20 standard, as it is not part of the standard's specified methods or events. Additionally, the function alters the balances in a way that is not covered by the standard. ERC-20 tokens are expected to have a consistent and predictable behavior for transfers, approvals, and allowances, and the `reflect` function introduces additional behavior that could be confusing or unexpected for users and interfacing contracts expecting a standard ERC-20 token.

Moreover, the `reflect` function could potentially disrupt integrations with other contracts or services that assume compliance with the ERC-20 standard. For example, decentralized exchanges or wallet interfaces might not account for the reflection mechanism and could display incorrect balances or fail to properly execute transactions.

In conclusion, while the `reflect` function and related parts of the `SiberianHusky` contract do not conform to the ERC-20 standard, it is important to note that the ERC-20 standard does not prohibit additional functionality. However, such functionality should be clearly documented, and contract developers should be aware that adding non-standard features could impact interoperability with other contracts and services that expect strict ERC-20 compliance.
