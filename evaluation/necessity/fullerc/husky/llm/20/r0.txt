The provided Solidity code for the `SiberianHusky` contract appears to implement a token with reflection mechanics, which is not a standard feature of the ERC-20 token standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to ensure interoperability with other contracts, wallets, and clients that expect ERC-20 behavior.

The `reflectionFromToken` function in the `SiberianHusky` contract is not part of the ERC-20 standard. This function calculates the amount of "reflection" (a kind of reward or redistribution mechanism) that a holder would receive based on the amount of tokens they are transferring, with an option to deduct a transfer fee.

While the `reflectionFromToken` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard (since adding additional functions beyond the standard is allowed), it is important to ensure that the core ERC-20 functions (`totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`) behave according to the specification. The reflection mechanism should not interfere with the expected behavior of these functions.

For example, the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions must accurately reflect the balance changes in the sender's and recipient's accounts, and they must emit the `Transfer` event. If the reflection mechanism alters the balances in a way that is not transparent or expected by users interacting with what they believe to be a standard ERC-20 token, it could be considered a violation of the standard's principles, even if it does not violate the letter of the standard.

In summary, the `reflectionFromToken` function and related parts do not directly violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard allows for additional functions beyond those specified. However, it is crucial that the core ERC-20 functions still operate as expected and that any additional features like reflection do not obscure or alter the standard behavior in a way that could mislead users or other contracts interacting with the token.
