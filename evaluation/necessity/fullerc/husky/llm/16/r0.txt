The function `totalFees` in the provided Solidity code does not violate the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement to enable interoperability with other contracts, wallets, and marketplaces. These functions include `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`, along with the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.

The `totalFees` function is not part of the ERC-20 standard, but adding additional functions to an ERC-20 compliant contract does not violate the standard as long as the required functions and events are correctly implemented and behave as specified. The `totalFees` function is a custom function that appears to return the total amount of fees collected by the contract, which is a feature specific to the `SiberianHusky` contract and does not interfere with ERC-20 compliance.

It's important to note that while the `totalFees` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, the contract must still implement all the required functions and events as per the standard to be considered ERC-20 compliant. The provided code snippet does not show the implementation of these required functions and events, so it is not possible to determine the full compliance of the `SiberianHusky` contract with ERC-20 based on the given information alone.
