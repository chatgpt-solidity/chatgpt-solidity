The `tokenFromReflection` function provided in the `SiberianHusky` contract is not part of the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token should implement to ensure interoperability with other contracts and clients. These functions include `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`, along with the `Transfer` and `Approval` events.

The `tokenFromReflection` function appears to be a utility function specific to the `SiberianHusky` contract, which is used to convert "reflected" tokens (a concept not part of the ERC-20 standard) back into the token's standard balance representation. This function, along with the reflection mechanism, is an additional feature implemented by the contract developers and does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as long as the contract also implements all the required ERC-20 functions and events.

However, it's important to note that while the `tokenFromReflection` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, it is not a required or recognized function within the standard. It is a custom function that is specific to this contract's implementation. Users and developers interacting with this contract should be aware that this function is not part of the standard ERC-20 interface and should understand its purpose and behavior within the context of the `SiberianHusky` contract.

In summary, the `tokenFromReflection` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but it is also not part of the standard. The contract must still implement all the required ERC-20 functions and events to be considered ERC-20 compliant.
