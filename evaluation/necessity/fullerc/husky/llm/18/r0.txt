The `rescueFromContract` function in the provided Solidity code allows the owner of the `SiberianHusky` contract to withdraw all Ether (ETH) that may have been sent to the contract address. This function is not part of the ERC-20 standard, which is focused on token-related functionality, such as transferring tokens, approving tokens for spending by third parties, and querying token balances and allowances.

The ERC-20 standard does not specify anything about handling native Ether balances in a token contract. Therefore, the `rescueFromContract` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, as it does not interfere with any of the token-related functions or events that the standard defines.

However, it is important to note that while the function does not violate the ERC-20 standard, it is a privileged function that should be used with caution. It allows the contract owner to withdraw Ether from the contract, which could be a security risk if not properly managed or if the owner's account is compromised. This function should be well-documented, and its use should be transparent to the users of the contract.

In practice, it is common for contracts to include some form of a rescue function to allow the recovery of funds sent to the contract by mistake. This is considered a good practice as long as it is done transparently and with proper security measures in place to prevent abuse.
