The provided Solidity code for the `totalSupply` function and the related parts of the `SiberianHusky` contract appear to be compliant with the ERC-20 token standard as described in the provided ERC documentation.

The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `totalSupply` function should return the total token supply, and the code provided does exactly that:

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view override returns (uint256) {
    return _tTotal;
}
```

The `_tTotal` variable is a private constant that represents the total supply of the token, which is set to `100000000000 * 10 ** 6 * 10 ** 9`. This is a common pattern in ERC-20 tokens to define the total supply as a constant value, and the `totalSupply` function simply returns this value.

The ERC-20 standard does not specify the value that the total supply should have, only that there should be a function to return it. Therefore, the value of `_tTotal` does not violate the standard as long as it correctly represents the total number of tokens in existence for the `SiberianHusky` contract.

Additionally, the contract inherits from `IERC20`, which is the interface for ERC-20 tokens, and it correctly overrides the `totalSupply` function as required by the interface.

In conclusion, based on the provided code snippet and the ERC-20 standard documentation, there is no violation in the implementation of the `totalSupply` function. However, to fully ensure compliance with the ERC-20 standard, the rest of the contract's functions and events would also need to be reviewed, as the ERC-20 standard includes a set of functions (`balanceOf`, `transfer`, `approve`, `allowance`, `transferFrom`) and events (`Transfer`, `Approval`) that must be implemented according to the specification.
