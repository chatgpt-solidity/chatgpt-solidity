The function `owner()` and the related parts provided in the Solidity code snippet are part of a contract that appears to implement an ownership pattern, typically found in the `Ownable` contract. This pattern is used to restrict access to certain functions to only the owner of the contract, which is a common practice in many smart contracts to provide administrative control.

The ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) provided is describing the ERC-20 standard, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a token contract should implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These functions and events relate to the transfer of tokens, querying token balances, and allowing tokens to be approved for spending by third parties.

The `owner()` function in the `Ownable` contract does not directly relate to the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-20 standard does not require a token to have an `owner()` function or any ownership-related functionality. The `owner()` function is part of the contract's access control mechanism and is not involved in the token transfer mechanics or balance queries that the ERC-20 standard specifies.

Therefore, the `owner()` function and the related parts do not violate the ERC-20 standard because the standard does not mandate the presence or absence of such ownership patterns. The `Ownable` contract can be used in conjunction with an ERC-20 token contract to provide administrative control over certain aspects of the token contract (such as minting new tokens or pausing transfers), but it is not part of the ERC-20 token standard itself.

In conclusion, the `owner()` function and related parts do not violate the ERC-20 standard, as they serve a different purpose unrelated to the token interface defined by ERC-20.
