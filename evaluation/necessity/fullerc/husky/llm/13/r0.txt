The `increaseAllowance` function provided in the `SiberianHusky` contract is not explicitly defined in the ERC-20 standard. However, it is a convenience function that is commonly implemented in many ERC-20 tokens to make it easier for users to increase the allowance for a spender without having to set it explicitly with the `approve` function.

The ERC-20 standard defines the `approve` function, which sets the allowance for a spender to a certain value. The `increaseAllowance` function builds on top of this by allowing a user to increase the current allowance by a certain amount. This is useful because it allows users to add to the allowance without needing to know the current allowance amount.

The `increaseAllowance` function in the provided code uses the `SafeMath` library to safely add the `addedValue` to the current allowance to prevent overflow errors. It then calls the `_approve` internal function to update the allowance mapping and emit the `Approval` event, which is in line with the ERC-20 standard's requirement to emit an `Approval` event whenever the allowance is changed.

The ERC-20 standard does not enforce how the `approve` function should be implemented beyond the requirement that it sets the allowance and emits an event. Therefore, the `increaseAllowance` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as it correctly updates the allowance and emits the `Approval` event, which the provided code does.

However, it is important to note that the ERC-20 standard mentions a known issue with the `approve` function related to the potential for a race condition. This is why it is recommended (but not required) that the allowance is first set to zero before setting it to a new value for the same spender. The `increaseAllowance` function does not address this potential issue, but since the ERC-20 standard explicitly states that the contract itself shouldn't enforce setting the allowance to zero first, this is not a violation of the standard.

In conclusion, the `increaseAllowance` function and the related parts provided in the `SiberianHusky` contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard. They provide additional functionality that is compatible with the standard's requirements for the `approve` function and the `Approval` event.
