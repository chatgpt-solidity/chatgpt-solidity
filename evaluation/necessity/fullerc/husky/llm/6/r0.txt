The ERC standard being referred to here is the ERC-20 token standard, which is a common standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement to be considered ERC-20 compliant.

The `decimals` function in the ERC-20 standard is defined as follows:

```
decimals
Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. 8, means to divide the token amount by 100000000 to get its user representation. OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals` function is optional. This means that a token contract does not need to implement this function to be ERC-20 compliant. However, if it does implement the `decimals` function, it should return the number of decimals the token uses.

In the provided Solidity code for the `SiberianHusky` contract, the `decimals` function is implemented and returns a `uint8` value representing the number of decimals the token uses:

```solidity
contract SiberianHusky is Context, IERC20, Ownable {
    uint8 private _decimals = 9;

    function decimals() public view returns (uint8) {
        return _decimals;
    }
}
```

The `SiberianHusky` contract sets the `_decimals` variable to `9`, which means that the token's user representation is divided by `1,000,000,000` (10^9). The `decimals` function correctly returns this value as a `uint8`.

Based on the information provided, the `decimals` function and the related parts in the `SiberianHusky` contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard. The contract correctly implements an optional function as specified by the standard, and it returns the appropriate value for the number of decimals used by the token.
