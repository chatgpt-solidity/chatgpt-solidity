The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and related parts of the `SiberianHusky` contract must be evaluated against the ERC-20 token standard to determine if there are any violations.

Here are some key points to consider when evaluating the `transferFrom` function against the ERC-20 standard:

1. **ERC-20 Compliance**: The `transferFrom` function should allow a spender to transfer tokens from one account to another, provided that the spender has been authorized to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the token owner. This authorization is typically granted through the `approve` function.

2. **Events**: The ERC-20 standard requires that a `Transfer` event is emitted whenever tokens are transferred, including by the `transferFrom` function.

3. **Allowance Mechanism**: The `transferFrom` function should respect the allowance mechanism, meaning it should not transfer more tokens than the spender is allowed to, as determined by the `_allowances` mapping.

4. **Error Handling**: The function should revert (throw an error) if the transfer is not possible due to insufficient balance or allowance.

5. **Return Value**: The function should return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.

Now, let's analyze the provided `transferFrom` function:

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address sender,
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount
) public override returns (bool) {
    _transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    _approve(
        sender,
        _msgSender(),
        _allowances[sender][_msgSender()].sub(
            amount,
            "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance"
        )
    );
    return true;
}
```

The `transferFrom` function in the `SiberianHusky` contract appears to follow the ERC-20 standard with the following observations:

- It calls an internal `_transfer` function to move the tokens from the sender to the recipient.
- It emits a `Transfer` event within the `_transfer` function (as seen in the `_transferStandard`, `_transferToExcluded`, `_transferBothExcluded`, and `_transferFromExcluded` functions).
- It correctly updates the allowance by calling the `_approve` function with the new allowance amount after subtracting the transferred amount.
- It uses the `SafeMath` library to prevent overflow and underflow issues, which is a good practice for security.
- It returns `true` to indicate success, as required by the ERC-20 standard.

However, there are a few potential issues and non-standard behaviors:

- The contract includes additional mechanisms such as transaction limits (`_maxTxAmount`), ownership checks, and excluded accounts, which are not part of the ERC-20 standard. These features could restrict the transfer of tokens in ways that are not expected by users or interfaces that assume standard ERC-20 behavior.
- The contract does not provide the `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `approve`, and `allowance` functions in the provided code snippet, which are part of the ERC-20 standard. These functions must be implemented elsewhere in the contract for full compliance.

In conclusion, the `transferFrom` function itself does not violate the ERC-20 standard, but the contract introduces additional features that are not part of the standard. If these features interfere with the expected behavior of standard ERC-20 functions, they could be considered a deviation from the standard. It is also important to ensure that all required ERC-20 functions are implemented in the contract, even though they are not included in the provided code snippet.
