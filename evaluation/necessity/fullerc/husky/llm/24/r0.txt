The provided Solidity function interfaces appear to be for an ERC-20 compliant token with some additional non-standard functions. The ERC-20 standard is a common standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, and it specifies a set of functions that a compliant token must implement.

Let's compare the provided interfaces with the ERC-20 standard:

**Standard ERC-20 Functions:**
1. `name() returns (string)` - OPTIONAL
2. `symbol() returns (string)` - OPTIONAL
3. `decimals() returns (uint8)` - OPTIONAL
4. `totalSupply() returns (uint256)`
5. `balanceOf(address) returns (uint256)`
6. `transfer(address, uint256) returns (bool)`
7. `approve(address, uint256) returns (bool)`
8. `allowance(address, address) returns (uint256)`
9. `transferFrom(address, address, uint256) returns (bool)`

**Standard ERC-20 Events:**
1. `Transfer(address indexed, address indexed, uint256)`
2. `Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256)`

The provided interfaces include all the standard ERC-20 functions, which means the contract should be ERC-20 compliant. However, the contract also includes additional functions that are not part of the ERC-20 standard:

- `renounceOwnership() returns()`
- `transferOwnership(address) returns()`
- `constructor() returns()`
- `increaseAllowance(address, uint256) returns(bool)`
- `decreaseAllowance(address, uint256) returns(bool)`
- `isExcluded(address) returns(bool)`
- `totalFees() returns(uint256)`
- `setMaxTxPercent(uint256) returns()`
- `rescueFromContract() returns()`
- `reflect(uint256) returns()`
- `reflectionFromToken(uint256, bool) returns(uint256)`
- `tokenFromReflection(uint256) returns(uint256)`
- `excludeAccount(address) returns()`
- `includeAccount(address) returns()`
- `_maxTxAmount() returns(uint256)`

These additional functions do not violate the ERC-20 standard, as the standard does not prohibit the presence of non-standard functions. However, they are not required by the ERC-20 standard and are likely to be part of a custom implementation that extends the basic functionality of an ERC-20 token.

In conclusion, the provided Solidity function interfaces do not violate the ERC-20 standard, but they do include additional functions that extend beyond the standard's requirements. These additional functions may provide extra features or administrative controls not found in a basic ERC-20 token.
