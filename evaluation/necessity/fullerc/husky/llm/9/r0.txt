The provided Solidity code for the `SiberianHusky` contract appears to be an implementation of an ERC20 token with some additional features. To determine whether the `transfer` function and related parts violate the given ERC (which is the ERC20 standard), we need to compare the code against the ERC20 specification.

Here are some key points from the ERC20 standard that we need to check against the provided code:

1. The `transfer` function should transfer the specified amount of tokens to the given address and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
2. The function should throw if the sender's balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
3. Transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

Now, let's analyze the provided `transfer` function and related parts:

- The `transfer` function in the `SiberianHusky` contract calls the internal `_transfer` function, passing the sender (retrieved via `_msgSender()`) and the recipient address along with the amount to be transferred.
- The `_transfer` function includes checks to ensure that neither the sender nor the recipient is the zero address and that the amount is greater than zero.
- The `_transfer` function also includes a check for the maximum transaction amount (`_maxTxAmount`) unless the sender or recipient is the owner of the contract. This is not a requirement of the ERC20 standard and could be considered an additional feature or restriction depending on the token's intended use case.
- The `_transfer` function handles different cases depending on whether the sender or recipient is excluded from rewards (presumably a feature of this particular token implementation).
- The `Transfer` event is emitted in all cases where a transfer occurs, which is compliant with the ERC20 standard.

Based on the provided code and the ERC20 standard, the `transfer` function and related parts seem to comply with the ERC20 requirements. However, there are additional features and restrictions (such as the maximum transaction amount and the concept of excluded addresses) that are not part of the ERC20 standard. These additional features do not violate the standard but are specific to this token's implementation.

It's important to note that the provided code does not include the entire contract, and there may be other parts of the contract that could affect compliance with the ERC20 standard. Additionally, the code uses a library called `SafeMath` for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows, which is a good practice for security.

In conclusion, based on the provided code snippet and the ERC20 standard, the `transfer` function and related parts do not violate the ERC20 standard, but they include additional features that extend beyond the basic requirements of the standard.
