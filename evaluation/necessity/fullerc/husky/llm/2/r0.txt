The provided Solidity code defines an `Ownable` contract that includes functionality to transfer ownership of the contract to a new owner. This is a common pattern used in many smart contracts to allow for administrative control over certain functions, typically restricted to the owner of the contract.

The ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) you've provided appears to be describing the ERC-20 standard, which is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a token contract should implement to enable interoperability with wallets, exchanges, and other contracts.

The `transferOwnership` function and related parts in the `Ownable` contract do not violate the ERC-20 standard because they are not part of the ERC-20 token functionality. The ERC-20 standard focuses on token-related operations such as transferring tokens, approving tokens to be spent by third parties, and querying token balances and allowances. It does not dictate how the administrative control of the contract should be managed.

The `Ownable` contract is a separate concern from the token functionality and is often used in conjunction with ERC-20 token contracts to provide a secure way to manage privileges such as pausing the contract, minting new tokens, or upgrading the contract. It is not specified in the ERC-20 standard and does not interfere with the token operations defined by the standard.

In conclusion, the `transferOwnership` function and related parts do not violate the ERC-20 standard, as they serve a different purpose and are not part of the ERC-20 token interface. They are a part of contract access control and are orthogonal to the ERC-20 specifications.
