To determine whether the provided Solidity code for the `SiberianHusky` contract and its constructor violates the ERC-20 standard, we need to compare the code against the ERC-20 specification provided.

The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of functions and events that a compliant token contract must implement. The provided code snippet includes the constructor for the `SiberianHusky` contract, which is an ERC-20 token contract, as well as the constructors for the `Ownable` and `Context` contracts, which are used as base contracts for `SiberianHusky`.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. The `SiberianHusky` contract inherits from `IERC20` and `Ownable`, which suggests that it aims to implement the ERC-20 interface and have an ownership mechanism.

2. The constructor of `SiberianHusky` initializes the total supply of tokens and assigns the entire supply to the deployer of the contract. It also emits a `Transfer` event with the `_from` address set to the zero address, which is in line with the ERC-20 specification for token creation.

3. The `Ownable` contract's constructor sets the deployer as the initial owner and emits an `OwnershipTransferred` event. This is not part of the ERC-20 standard but is a common pattern for managing ownership in Solidity contracts.

4. The `Context` contract provides an internal function `_msgSender()` to return the address of the sender of the message. This is a helper contract and does not directly relate to ERC-20 compliance.

From the provided code and the ERC-20 specification, there are no apparent violations of the ERC-20 standard. However, to fully assess ERC-20 compliance, we would need to see the implementation of the following functions, which are not included in the provided code snippet:

- `name()`
- `symbol()`
- `decimals()`
- `totalSupply()`
- `balanceOf(address _owner)`
- `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)`
- `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)`
- `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`
- `allowance(address _owner, address _spender)`

These functions are essential for a token contract to be considered ERC-20 compliant. The provided code snippet does not show the implementation of these functions, so we cannot conclude whether the `SiberianHusky` contract fully complies with the ERC-20 standard without the rest of the code.

In summary, based on the provided code snippet, there are no violations of the ERC-20 standard. However, a complete audit would require reviewing the full implementation of all ERC-20 required functions and events.
