NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0, nor does it reject such transfers. The code does not contain any logic that would violate the ERC rule stating that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The `_transfer` function will execute normally with a value of 0, as there are no conditions that would prevent it from doing so. Therefore, the code does not violate the given ERC rule.
