NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule. The rule states that the `_from` account must have deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the code, the `transferFrom` function checks that the `_value` to be transferred is less than or equal to the allowance that `_from` has given to `msg.sender` (the sender of the message). This allowance mechanism is a way for `_from` to authorize `msg.sender` to transfer tokens on their behalf, which aligns with the rule.

However, the code does not show how the allowance is set, which is typically done through an `approve` function in ERC20 tokens. Assuming that the `approve` function is implemented correctly elsewhere in the contract, and that it requires `_from` to deliberately set the allowance for `msg.sender`, then the code would be following the ERC rule as stated.
