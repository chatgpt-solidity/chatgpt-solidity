NO

The provided Solidity code for the `SilkToken` contract does not explicitly return a boolean value to indicate whether the transfer is successful or not. The `_transfer` function is used internally and does not return any value. The `transfer` function in the `TokenERC20` contract calls the `_transfer` function but also does not return any value.

To comply with the ERC rule that requires indicating whether the transfer is successful, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value. Here is an example of how the `transfer` function could be modified to comply with the rule:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This modification ensures that the function returns `true` if the transfer completes successfully, thus complying with the ERC rule.
