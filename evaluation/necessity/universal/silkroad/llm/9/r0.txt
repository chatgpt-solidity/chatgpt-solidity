The given Solidity code for the `approve` function sets the allowance for a `_spender` to spend a certain `_value` of tokens on behalf of the `msg.sender`. The function signature indicates that it returns a boolean value to signify success, and the function body indeed returns `true` after setting the allowance. This means the code complies with the given ERC rule, which states that the function should return whether the approve is successful. Since the function always returns `true` upon successful execution, it does not violate the rule.
