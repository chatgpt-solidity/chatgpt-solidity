NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly show any condition that would prevent transfers of 0 values from being treated as normal transfers. The `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract does not have any checks for the value being greater than 0 before proceeding with the transfer. Therefore, it can be inferred that a transfer of 0 value would be processed in the same manner as any other transfer, which is in compliance with the given ERC rule.
