Given a solidity code from a smart contract and a condition.
Whether the code contain the condition? Reply in "YES" or "NO".

Code:"""
contract StandardToken is ERC20, BasicToken {
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) internal allowed;

    /**
     * @dev Approve the passed address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of msg.sender.
     *
     * Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk that someone may use both the old
     * and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this
     * race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards:
     * https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
     * @param _spender The address which will spend the funds.
     * @param _value The amount of tokens to be spent.
