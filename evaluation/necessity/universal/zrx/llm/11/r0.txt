The given Solidity code for the `approve` function in the `StandardToken` contract does indeed return a boolean value indicating whether the `approve` operation is successful. The function returns `true` after setting the allowance amount in the `allowed` mapping and emitting an `Approval` event. There is no code path in the function that leads to a `false` return, which implies that the function assumes the approval will always be successful if it doesn't revert due to some other issue (like out-of-gas, etc.).

However, it's important to note that in practice, the `approve` function should also include checks to prevent race conditions or other potential issues, as recommended by ERC20 best practices. This code does not include such checks, but that is not what the given ERC rule is asking about. The rule only asks if the function returns whether the `approve` is successful, which this code does.
