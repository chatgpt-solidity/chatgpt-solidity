YES

The given Solidity code for the `transfer` function in the `StandardToken` contract does not explicitly use the `emit` keyword when triggering the `Transfer` event. The `emit` keyword is required by modern Solidity conventions (introduced in Solidity 0.4.21) to clearly indicate that an event is being emitted.

The correct way to emit the event according to the ERC rule would be:

```solidity
emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

However, the provided code uses the older syntax which was allowed before Solidity version 0.4.21:

```solidity
Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

This would be considered a violation of the given ERC rule if the rule assumes adherence to the modern Solidity syntax.
