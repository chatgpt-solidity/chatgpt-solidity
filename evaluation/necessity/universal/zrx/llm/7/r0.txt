NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule based on the information provided. The ERC rule states that the `_from` account must have authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the code, the `transferFrom` function checks for an allowance using the `allowed` mapping, which implies that there is a mechanism for `_from` to authorize a sender (msg.sender) to transfer tokens on their behalf.

The `allowed` mapping is a standard part of ERC20 tokens that tracks how much one address is allowed to spend on behalf of another address. The `transferFrom` function checks that the `msg.sender` has been authorized (allowed) to spend a certain amount of tokens from the `_from` address. If the allowance is sufficient (and other conditions such as balance sufficiency are met), the transfer proceeds, and the allowance is reduced accordingly (unless it is set to `MAX_UINT`, which represents an unlimited allowance).

Therefore, the code does not violate the rule as it includes a mechanism for authorization through allowances.
