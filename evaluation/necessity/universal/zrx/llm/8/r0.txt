NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The `transferFrom` function does not contain any condition that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated as a normal transfer. It checks if the balance is sufficient and if the allowance is sufficient, and if both conditions are met, it performs the transfer, even if the `_value` is 0. There is no special handling or rejection of transfers where `_value` is 0.
