NO

The given Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. The ERC rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, which means that the code should allow transfers of 0 values and handle them the same way as any other transfer.

In the provided `_transfer` function, there is no condition that prevents the transfer of 0 values. The function checks that the sender has enough balance, the recipient's address is not the zero address, and that the transfer will not cause an overflow on the recipient's balance. However, it does not reject a transfer of 0 value. Therefore, the code does not violate the given ERC rule.
