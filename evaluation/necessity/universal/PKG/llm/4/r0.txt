NO

The given Solidity code does not violate the provided ERC rule. The rule states that the "Transfer" event should be emitted. In the provided code, the last line of the `_transfer` function is:

```solidity
Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
```

This line is intended to emit a "Transfer" event, indicating that a transfer of tokens has occurred from `_from` to `_to` with the amount `_value`. However, the code is missing the `event` declaration for the "Transfer" event, and the syntax for emitting events has changed in newer versions of Solidity (0.4.21 and later) to use the `emit` keyword:

```solidity
emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
```

Despite the outdated syntax and missing event declaration, the intention to emit the "Transfer" event is present, which means the code is attempting to follow the ERC rule. If the `event Transfer` declaration is present elsewhere in the full contract code and the Solidity compiler version used is compatible with the syntax, then the code would not be violating the rule. If the `event Transfer` declaration is missing, then the code would be incomplete rather than violating the rule as stated.
