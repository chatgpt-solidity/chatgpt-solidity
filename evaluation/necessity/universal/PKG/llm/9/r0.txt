The Solidity code provided does implement a function `approve` that returns a boolean indicating whether the approval is successful. The function sets the allowance for the `_spender` to `_value` and then emits an `Approval` event before returning `true`. However, the code does not follow the ERC-20 standard completely because it lacks the `event Approval` declaration that is required to emit events in Solidity.

The ERC-20 standard requires that an `Approval` event is declared in the contract and emitted when approvals are made, so that external subscribers can be notified of the change in allowance. The code snippet provided does not include this event declaration, which is a technical violation of the ERC-20 standard, but the question specifically asks about the return value of the `approve` function, which is correctly implemented as per the given rule. 

Therefore, based on the rule provided, which only asks about the return value of the `approve` function, the code does not violate the rule. However, it is worth noting that the code is not fully ERC-20 compliant due to the missing event declaration.
