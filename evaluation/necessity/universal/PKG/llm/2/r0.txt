NO

The given Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. The ERC rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, and there is no code in the provided `_transfer` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 from being processed like any other transfer. The function checks that the sender has enough balance and that the recipient's address is not the zero address, but it does not reject a transfer of 0 tokens. Therefore, it does not violate the given ERC rule.
