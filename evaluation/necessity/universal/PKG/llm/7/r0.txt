The code provided does indeed return whether the transfer is successful. The `transferFrom` function returns a boolean value `true` upon successful completion of the transfer. The `_transfer` function is called within `transferFrom`, and while `_transfer` itself does not return a value (since it is an internal function), it is designed to revert the transaction if any of the `require` statements fail, which would prevent `transferFrom` from returning `true`. If the transaction does not revert, `transferFrom` will reach the `return true;` statement and successfully indicate that the transfer was successful.

However, there is a minor issue in the code: the `Transfer` event is called without being declared. In Solidity, events should be declared with the `event` keyword. To comply with ERC-20, the event should be declared as follows:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
```

This event declaration is missing in the provided code, but this does not affect the return value of the transfer's success. It is an issue related to event logging, not the rule specified.
