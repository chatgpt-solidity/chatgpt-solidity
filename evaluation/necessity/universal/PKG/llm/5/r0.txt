NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule. The ERC rule states that the `_from` account must have authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the code, the `transferFrom` function checks that the `msg.sender` has an allowance from the `_from` account before allowing the transfer to proceed (`require(_value <= allowance[_from][msg.sender]);`). This implies that there must have been a prior call to a function (not shown in the provided code) that sets the allowance, which is the mechanism by which `_from` authorizes the sender.

However, it's important to note that the code does not show the function that would set the allowance (such as an `approve` function), so we cannot see the full authorization mechanism in place. But based on the `transferFrom` function alone, it does not violate the rule that the `_from` account must authorize the sender.
