NO

The given Solidity code for the `BaseToken` contract does not explicitly return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer operation. The `transfer` function calls the internal `_transfer` function, which performs the transfer if all the requirements are met, but it does not return any value. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful.

To comply with the ERC rule stated, the `transfer` function should be modified to return a boolean value. Here's how the code could be updated to comply with the rule:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

Additionally, the `Transfer` event should be declared according to the ERC-20 standard, which is not shown in the provided code snippet. It should be something like this:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
```

This event declaration is necessary for the contract to be compliant with the ERC-20 standard, but it does not affect the return value of the `transfer` function.
