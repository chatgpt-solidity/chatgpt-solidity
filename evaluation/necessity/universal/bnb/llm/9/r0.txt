NO

The given Solidity code for the `approve` function does indeed return a boolean value indicating whether the approval is successful. The function returns `true` if the approval process does not throw an exception and the `_value` is greater than 0. If `_value` is less than or equal to 0, the function will throw an exception and revert the transaction, which implicitly indicates that the approval was not successful. However, the code does not explicitly return `false` in any case, because the `throw` statement will stop execution and revert all changes if the condition is met.

It's important to note that using `throw` for error handling in Solidity is an outdated practice and has been replaced by `require` statements, which are more gas-efficient. The `throw` keyword has been deprecated in favor of `revert()`, `require()`, and `assert()` with the release of Solidity 0.4.13. The code provided seems to be using an older version of Solidity.
