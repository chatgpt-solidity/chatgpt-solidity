YES

The given Solidity code for the contract `BNB` includes a `transfer` function that is intended to emit a `Transfer` event to notify listeners of the transfer action. However, the code provided does not define the `Transfer` event, nor does it use the `emit` keyword to emit the event, which is required by the ERC-20 standard for token transfer events.

The correct implementation should include the event definition and use the `emit` keyword to emit the event when a transfer occurs, like so:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

...

emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

Since the provided code does not follow this pattern, it violates the given ERC rule.
