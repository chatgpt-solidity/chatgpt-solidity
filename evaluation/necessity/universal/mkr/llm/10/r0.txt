NO

The code provided does include an `Approval` event emission in the `approve` function of the `DSTokenBase` contract. The line `Approval(msg.sender, guy, wad);` is responsible for emitting the `Approval` event whenever the `approve` function is called, which is in compliance with the ERC-20 standard that requires an `Approval` event to be emitted when approval is given by an owner to a spender.

However, it's worth noting that the `Approval` event should be emitted using the `emit` keyword according to the latest Solidity standards (e.g., `emit Approval(msg.sender, guy, wad);`). The code provided does not use the `emit` keyword, but this could be due to the code being written in an older version of Solidity where the `emit` keyword was not required. If the ERC rule specifically requires the use of the `emit` keyword, then the code would not be compliant with that specific rule. But based on the information provided, the code does not violate the general rule of emitting the `Approval` event.
