The provided Solidity code does not contain any functionality related to minting or allocating tokens. It is a contract that seems to handle authorization, with functions to set an owner and check if an address is authorized to perform certain actions. There is no mention of a token balance or a transfer function that would indicate the minting or allocation of tokens.

Regarding the ERC rule to "emit Event Transfer," the provided code does not contain any event emission that corresponds to a token transfer event. The only event that is mentioned is `LogSetOwner`, which is related to setting the owner of the contract, not transferring tokens.

Therefore, the answer to both questions is "NO".
