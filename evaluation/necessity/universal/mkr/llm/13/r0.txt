The given Solidity code does not violate the provided ERC rule. The ERC rule states that the `approve` function should return whether the approval is successful. In the provided code, the `approve` function in the `DSTokenBase` contract does indeed return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation. It sets the approval amount and then emits an `Approval` event, following the standard practice for ERC20 tokens, and finally returns `true` to indicate success.

The `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract overrides the one in `DSTokenBase` and calls `super.approve(guy, uint(-1))`, which will call the `approve` function from `DSTokenBase` with the maximum possible uint256 value. This is a common pattern to allow unlimited approvals, and it also returns a boolean indicating success, as per the ERC rule.
