NO

The given Solidity code does not violate the provided ERC rule. The ERC rule states that the `approve` function should return whether the approval is successful. In the provided code, both implementations of the `approve` function in `DSToken` and `DSTokenBase` return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.

In `DSTokenBase`, the `approve` function explicitly sets the allowance in the `_approvals` mapping and then returns `true`, indicating success. It also emits an `Approval` event, which is in line with the ERC20 standard.

In `DSToken`, the `approve` function calls the base implementation using `super.approve(guy, wad)` and returns the result. Since the base implementation returns `true`, the `DSToken`'s `approve` function will also return `true`, indicating success, provided that the `stoppable` modifier does not revert (which would happen if `stopped` is `true`).

Therefore, the code complies with the given ERC rule.
