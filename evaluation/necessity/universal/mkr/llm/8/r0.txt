NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly show any condition that would prevent transfers of 0 values. The `transferFrom` function in the `DSToken` contract does not include any checks for the transfer amount (`wad`) being greater than 0. Therefore, it can be inferred that a transfer of 0 value would be processed in the same way as any other transfer, which is in compliance with the given ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers."
