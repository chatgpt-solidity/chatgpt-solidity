NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value in the `transferFrom` function. According to the ERC rule that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers," the code should allow transfers of 0 value to proceed without any special treatment or restrictions.

Since the code does not contain any logic that would treat a transfer of 0 value differently from any other transfer, it complies with the given ERC rule. There is no condition in the `transferFrom` function that would revert or behave differently if the `wad` (the amount to be transferred) is 0. Therefore, the code does not violate the ERC rule.
