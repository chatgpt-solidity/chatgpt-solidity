YES

The given Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract does not explicitly emit an event with the name `Event Transfer`. Instead, it emits an event named `Transfer` without the prefix `Event`. According to the ERC-20 standard, the event should be named `Transfer` and not `Event Transfer`. If the ERC rule provided is strictly requiring the event to be named `Event Transfer`, then the code violates this rule. However, it's important to note that the ERC-20 standard specifies the event should be named `Transfer`, so the rule provided seems to be incorrect if it's referring to the ERC-20 standard.
