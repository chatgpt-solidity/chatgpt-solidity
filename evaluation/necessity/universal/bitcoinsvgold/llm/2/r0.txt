NO

The given Solidity code does not explicitly throw a message stating that the caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend. Instead, it performs a check to see if the sender has enough balance (`balances[msg.sender] >= _value`) and if the value to be transferred is greater than 0 (`_value > 0`). If these conditions are not met, the function simply returns `false` without providing a specific error message. 

To comply with the given ERC rule, the code should include a require statement or revert with an error message indicating that the sender's balance is insufficient. For example:

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value, "Caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend");
```

Since this is not present in the provided code, it does not meet the specified ERC rule.
