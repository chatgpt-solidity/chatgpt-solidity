NO

The given Solidity code does not violate the provided ERC rule. The rule states that the "Approval" event should be emitted, and in the provided code, the `Approval` event is indeed emitted after setting the allowance in the `approve` function:

```solidity
Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
```

However, it's worth noting that the code snippet is not complete and does not show the event declaration, but based on the context, we can infer that the `Approval` event is declared elsewhere in the contract or in an interface it implements (such as ERC-20). The `Approval` event is a standard part of the ERC-20 token interface, which is used to log the approval of a spender by an owner to spend tokens on their behalf.
