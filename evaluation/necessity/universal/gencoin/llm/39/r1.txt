Regarding the condition:

The code provided does show an initial allocation of tokens in the constructor of the `GEIMCOIN` contract:

```solidity
balances[msg.sender] = 500000000000000000000000;
totalSupply = 500000000000000000000000;
```

This indicates that the contract is minting or allocating an initial amount of tokens to the creator's address (`msg.sender`). So, the answer to whether the code contains the condition "tokens are minting or allocating" is:

YES

Regarding the ERC rule:

The provided code snippet does not show the emission of a Transfer event upon the initial allocation of tokens. According to the ERC-20 standard, a Transfer event should be emitted when tokens are transferred, including when they are created and assigned for the first time. The code should include something like this:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```

And in the constructor or any function where tokens are transferred or minted, it should emit the event:

```solidity
emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, totalSupply);
```

Since the provided code does not include the emission of a Transfer event, it violates the ERC rule that states "emit Event Transfer". So, the answer to whether the code violates the given ERC rule is:

YES
