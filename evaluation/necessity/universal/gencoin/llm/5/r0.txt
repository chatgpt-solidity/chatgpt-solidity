NO

The code provided does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard rule that states "Return whether the transfer is successful." While the `transfer` function does return a boolean indicating the success of the transfer, the code does not follow the ERC-20 standard in terms of event emission.

In ERC-20, the event should be emitted with the correct name and parameters. The correct event name according to the ERC-20 standard is `Transfer`, and it should be emitted with three parameters: the sender address, the receiver address, and the amount transferred. However, the code provided does not define the `Transfer` event, which means that even though the function returns a success flag, it does not emit the necessary event upon a successful transfer, which is part of the standard's requirements.

The correct implementation should include an event definition like this:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
```

And the event should be emitted correctly within the function:

```solidity
emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

Since the code does not show the event definition and does not use the `emit` keyword (which is required since Solidity 0.4.21), it does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard.
