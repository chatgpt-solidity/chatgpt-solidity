NO

The given Solidity code does not violate the provided ERC rule. The rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers. In the provided code, there is no explicit check that would prevent a transfer of 0 value. The condition `_value > 0` is not excluding the possibility of a 0 value transfer; it is simply part of the logical conditions to ensure that the `_from` address has enough balance and the `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer the specified `_value`.

If `_value` is 0, the conditions `balances[_from] >= _value` and `allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value` would still hold true, and the transfer would proceed, effectively treating a transfer of 0 value as a normal transfer.
