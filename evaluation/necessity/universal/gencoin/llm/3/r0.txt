YES

The given Solidity code for the `transfer` function in the `StandardToken` contract does not use the `emit` keyword when triggering the `Transfer` event. The `emit` keyword is required for emitting events in Solidity (introduced in Solidity 0.4.21). The correct syntax to emit an event is:

```solidity
emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

However, the provided code uses the old syntax which was valid before Solidity version 0.4.21:

```solidity
Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

Since the ERC rule specifies that the `emit` keyword must be used when emitting events, the provided code violates this rule.
