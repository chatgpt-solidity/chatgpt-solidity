The code provided does implement a function `transferFrom` that returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. The function returns `true` if the transfer conditions are met (sufficient balance and allowance, and a non-zero transfer value) and `false` otherwise, which is in line with the ERC rule that states the function should "Return whether the transfer is successful."
