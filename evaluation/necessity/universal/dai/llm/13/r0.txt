YES

The given Solidity code does not violate the ERC rule provided. The ERC rule states that the `approve` function should return whether the approval is successful. In the provided code, the `approve` function in the `DSTokenBase` contract returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation, which is `true` after setting the approval amount.

The `DSToken` contract's `approve` function overrides the `approve` function from `DSTokenBase` and also returns a boolean value, indicating the success of the operation. It uses the `stoppable` modifier to ensure that the function can only be called when the contract is not stopped. If the contract is not stopped, it calls the `approve` function from the `DSTokenBase` with the maximum possible approval amount (`uint(-1)`), which should also return `true`.

Therefore, the code complies with the ERC rule that the `approve` function should indicate whether the approval was successful.
