YES

The given Solidity code defines an `approve` function in the `DSTokenBase` contract which is intended to emit an `Approval` event when an approval is granted. However, the code provided does not define the `Approval` event, it only attempts to emit it with the line `Approval(msg.sender, guy, wad);`.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `Approval` event should be emitted whenever the `approve` function is called and successfully executes. The event should be defined in the contract as follows:

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
```

Since the event is not defined in the provided code, but the code attempts to emit it, this would result in a compilation error. Therefore, the code violates the given ERC rule which requires the `Approval` event to be emitted properly.
