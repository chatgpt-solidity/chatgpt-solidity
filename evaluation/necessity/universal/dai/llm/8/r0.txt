NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value. The ERC rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers. Since the code does not contain any condition that would treat a transfer of 0 differently, it complies with the given ERC rule by default. All transfers, including those of 0 value, will go through the same logic without any special handling or rejection.
