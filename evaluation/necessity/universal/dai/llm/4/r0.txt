NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value in the `transfer` or `transferFrom` functions. According to the ERC rule that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers," the code should allow transfers of 0 value to proceed as they would for any other amount.

Since there is no condition in the code that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated like any other transfer, the code does not violate the given ERC rule. It will execute the transfer logic, update balances (which would remain the same in the case of a 0 transfer), and emit a Transfer event, thus treating a 0 value transfer as a normal transfer.
