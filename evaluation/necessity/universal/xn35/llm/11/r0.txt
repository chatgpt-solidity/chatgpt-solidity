The given Solidity code for the `approve` function in the `Projecton` contract does indeed return a boolean value indicating whether the `approve` operation is successful. The function sets the allowance for the `_spender` to use `_value` tokens on behalf of `msg.sender`, and then emits an `Approval` event. Finally, it returns `true`, indicating success.

However, the code provided does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard for the following reasons:

1. The `approve` function should emit the `Approval` event using the `emit` keyword, which is missing in the provided code. The correct line should be `emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);`.

2. The `approve` function signature is missing the `public` visibility specifier and the `override` keyword (assuming `IERC20` is an interface that the `Projecton` contract is meant to implement).

3. The `approve` function does not have a return type specified in the function signature. It should be specified as `public override returns (bool)`.

4. The `owned` contract and `IERC20` interface are not provided, so it's not possible to verify if there are any additional issues related to inheritance or interface implementation.

5. The `Approval` event is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it should be defined according to the ERC-20 standard.

6. The code does not check for potential race conditions that could occur with the `approve` function. The ERC-20 standard does not mandate a specific way to handle this, but it is a known issue that many ERC-20 tokens address by requiring the current allowance to be 0 before it can be changed or by using a pattern like `increaseApproval` and `decreaseApproval`.

While the code does return a boolean value indicating success, it is not fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard for the reasons mentioned above.
