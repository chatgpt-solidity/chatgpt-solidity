YES

The given Solidity code for the `transfer` function in the `Projecton` contract does not use the `emit` keyword when triggering the `Transfer` event. The correct syntax according to the ERC-20 standard for emitting events is to use the `emit` keyword followed by the event name and the parameters.

The line in the code that violates the ERC rule is:
```solidity
Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

It should be written as:
```solidity
emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

This is necessary to comply with the ERC-20 standard and newer versions of Solidity (0.4.21 and later) which require the `emit` keyword for triggering events.
