NO

The given Solidity code does not explicitly violate the provided ERC rule that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The `transferFrom` function in the code does not contain any condition that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated as a normal transfer. The condition `_value > 0` is not present, which means that the function should allow transfers of 0 value to proceed. However, the code does not show the implementation of the `transfer` function, which is also relevant to this rule. To fully determine compliance, the `transfer` function would also need to be reviewed.
