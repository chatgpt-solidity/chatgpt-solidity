The provided Solidity code does not explicitly show a mechanism for the `_from` account to authorize the `msg.sender`. The `transferFrom` function checks if the `msg.sender` is allowed to spend a certain amount on behalf of `_from` by checking the `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` mapping, but the code snippet does not include the function that would be used to set this allowance, which is typically a function named `approve` in ERC20 tokens.

The ERC rule you've provided seems to be a paraphrase of the requirement that a user must authorize a spender before the `transferFrom` function can be used to move funds. Since the actual `approve` function or mechanism is not shown in the provided code, we cannot definitively say that the code violates the ERC rule based on the snippet alone. However, the `transferFrom` function itself adheres to the standard ERC20 behavior by checking the allowance before proceeding with the transfer.
