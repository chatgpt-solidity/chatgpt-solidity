NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule. The rule states that the `_from` account must have deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the code, the `transferFrom` function checks whether the `msg.sender` has an allowance from the `_from` account before allowing the transfer:

```solidity
if (allowances[_from][msg.sender] < _value) return false;
```

This line ensures that the `_from` account has set an allowance for the `msg.sender` to spend a certain amount of tokens on its behalf. If the allowance is less than the `_value` to be transferred, the function returns false, effectively preventing the transfer. This mechanism is a standard way to authorize a third party to transfer tokens in ERC-20 compliant contracts, which is what this code appears to be implementing.

Therefore, the code does not violate the rule as it includes a mechanism for the `_from` account to authorize the sender of the message (`msg.sender`).
