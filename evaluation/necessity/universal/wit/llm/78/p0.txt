Given a solidity code from a smart contract and a condition.
Whether the code contain the condition? Reply in "YES" or "NO".

Code:"""
contract WiT is AbstractToken {

     * Address of the owner of this smart contract.
     */
    address private owner;

    /*A user is able to unintentionally send tokens to a contract
     * and if the contract is not prepared to refund them they will get stuck in the contract.
     * The same issue used to happen for Ether too but new Solidity versions added the payable modifier to
     * prevent unintended Ether transfers. However, thereâ€™s no such mechanism for token transfers.
     * so the below function is created
     */
