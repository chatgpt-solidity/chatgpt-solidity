NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule. The rule states that the `_from` account must have authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the code, the `transferFrom` function checks that the `msg.sender` has an allowance from the `_from` account before proceeding with the transfer:

```solidity
require(_value <= allowance[_from][msg.sender]); // Check allowance
```

This line ensures that the `_from` account has set an allowance for the `msg.sender` to spend a certain amount of tokens on its behalf. If the allowance is not sufficient, the transaction will revert. This mechanism is typically used to authorize a third party to transfer tokens, which is in line with the ERC rule that requires authorization.

However, the code does not show the function that sets the allowance, which is usually a function like `approve`. Without seeing the implementation of the `approve` function or the mechanism by which allowances are granted, we cannot fully assess whether the authorization process complies with all aspects of the ERC rule. But based on the information given, the code snippet provided does not violate the rule regarding authorization for `transferFrom`.
