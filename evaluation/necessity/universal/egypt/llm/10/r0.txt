The given Solidity code for the `approve` function in the `Egypt` contract does indeed return a boolean value indicating whether the approval is successful. The function sets the allowance for `_spender` to spend `_value` tokens on behalf of `msg.sender` and then emits an `Approval` event. Finally, it returns `true`, indicating success. This behavior is compliant with the ERC-20 standard for the `approve` function, which should return a boolean value to indicate success.
