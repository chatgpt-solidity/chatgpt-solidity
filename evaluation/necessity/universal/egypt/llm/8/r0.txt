YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. The function signature includes `returns (bool success)`, and at the end of the function, it returns `true` after the `_transfer` internal function is called without any errors. If any of the `require` statements fail, the transaction will revert, and it will not return any value, which implicitly indicates that the transfer was not successful. Therefore, the code complies with the given ERC rule that states it should "Return whether the transfer is successful."
