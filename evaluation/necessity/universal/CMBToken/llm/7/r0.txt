NO

The provided Solidity code does not directly violate the given ERC rule. The ERC rule states that the `_from` account must have deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the `transferFrom` function, the `require` statement checks that the `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to `_value`, which implies that `_from` has authorized `msg.sender` to transfer `_value` tokens on their behalf. This is a standard mechanism in ERC20 tokens for delegated transfer, typically established through the `approve` function (which is not shown in the provided code but is part of the ERC20 standard).

However, there is a mistake in the `transferFrom` function where it incorrectly updates the `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` mapping. It should subtract `_value` from `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` instead of `balances[msg.sender]`. The correct line should be:

```solidity
allowed[_from][msg.sender] = allowed[_from][msg.sender].sub(_value);
```

This error does not relate to the authorization rule but is a logical error in the contract's implementation of the `transferFrom` function.
