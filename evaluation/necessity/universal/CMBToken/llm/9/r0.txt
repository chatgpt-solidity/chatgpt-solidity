NO

The code provided does not violate the given ERC rule. The `transferFrom` function in the `CMBToken` contract does return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. If the conditions in the `require` statement are met, the function proceeds to execute the transfer and returns `true`. If the conditions are not met, the transaction will revert due to the `require` statement, and no boolean is explicitly returned because the transaction fails. However, the implicit behavior is that the function returns `false` in case of failure due to the revert. 

The ERC rule is followed as the function provides a return value indicating the success of the transfer.
