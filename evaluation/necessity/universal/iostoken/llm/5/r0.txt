The code provided does not explicitly return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer as required by the ERC rule. The ERC rule states that the function should return whether the transfer is successful, which typically means the function signature should include a return type of `bool` and explicitly return `true` or `false`.

However, the provided code does have a return type of `bool` and returns `true` when the transfer is successful and `false` otherwise. But the code is missing the `public` visibility specifier and the `event` declaration for `Transfer`, which are typically required by ERC-20 standards. Additionally, the `returns` keyword should be followed by parentheses in the function signature.

A more compliant version of the `transfer` function according to the ERC-20 standard would look like this:

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);
    require(balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to]); // This line is to prevent overflow.

    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This version includes the `public` visibility specifier, uses `require` for input validation, and uses `emit` to properly declare the event. It also explicitly returns `true` when the transfer is successful, which is in line with the ERC rule provided.
