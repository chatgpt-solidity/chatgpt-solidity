NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. The code checks if the sender has enough balance and if the recipient's balance will not overflow when the value is added. If these conditions are met, the transfer proceeds, regardless of whether the value is 0 or more. Therefore, the code does not violate the given ERC rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers.
