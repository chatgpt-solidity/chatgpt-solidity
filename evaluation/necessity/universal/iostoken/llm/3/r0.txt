YES

The given Solidity code for the `transfer` function in the `RegularToken` contract does not explicitly use the `emit` keyword when triggering the `Transfer` event. The `emit` keyword is required by modern Solidity conventions (introduced in Solidity 0.4.21) to clearly indicate that an event is being emitted.

The correct way to emit the event according to the ERC rule would be:

```solidity
emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

However, the code provided uses the older syntax which was allowed before the `emit` keyword was introduced:

```solidity
Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

This would have been valid in older versions of Solidity, but it violates the current ERC rule that requires the use of the `emit` keyword when emitting events.
