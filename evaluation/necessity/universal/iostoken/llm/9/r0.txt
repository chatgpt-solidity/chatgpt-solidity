YES

The given Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function in the `UnboundedRegularToken` contract does indeed return whether the transfer is successful. The function returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating the success of the transfer.

The function checks if the balance of the `_from` address is sufficient, if the allowance is sufficient (or unlimited, represented by `MAX_UINT`), and if the balance of the `_to` address will not overflow after the transfer. If all conditions are met, the transfer proceeds, the balances are updated, the allowance is decreased (unless it's unlimited), the `Transfer` event is emitted, and the function returns `true`. If any of the conditions are not met, the function returns `false`, indicating the transfer was not successful.
