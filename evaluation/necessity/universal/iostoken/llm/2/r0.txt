YES

The given Solidity code for the `transfer` function does not explicitly throw an error message indicating that the caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend. Instead, it returns `false` if the sender does not have enough balance. The ERC rule requires that an error message be thrown, which is typically done using `require` statements or `revert` in Solidity to provide feedback about the failure. The code should be modified to include a `require` statement that checks the sender's balance and throws an error if the balance is insufficient.
