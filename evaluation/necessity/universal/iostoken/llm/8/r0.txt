NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. According to the ERC-20 standard, transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, which means they should go through the same validation checks as any other transfer and emit a Transfer event if successful.

In the given `transferFrom` function, there is no condition that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated as a normal transfer. The function checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the `_value` and if the allowance is greater than or equal to the `_value`. If `_value` is 0, these conditions will be true (assuming the sender has a non-negative balance and allowance), and the function will proceed to execute the transfer, updating balances and allowances as necessary, and emit a Transfer event.

Therefore, the code does not violate the given ERC rule.
