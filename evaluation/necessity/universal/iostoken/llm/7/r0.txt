NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule based on the information provided. The ERC rule states that the `_from` account must have authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the code, the `transferFrom` function checks for an allowance with `allowed[_from][msg.sender]`, which implies that `_from` has set an allowance for `msg.sender`. If the allowance is sufficient for the `_value` being transferred, the function proceeds with the transfer, which aligns with the standard behavior of an ERC20 token's `transferFrom` function.

However, the code does not show the mechanism by which the allowance is set, so we cannot determine if the authorization process itself adheres to the ERC rule without additional context. The rule seems to be more about the process of authorization rather than the transfer itself. The code provided only shows the transfer logic, assuming that authorization has already been granted.
