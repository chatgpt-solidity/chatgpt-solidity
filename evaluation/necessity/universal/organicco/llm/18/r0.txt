NO

The given Solidity code for the `approve` function in the `Organicco` contract does not strictly follow the ERC-20 standard rule that states "Return whether the approve is successful." The ERC-20 standard requires that the `approve` function returns a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

While the `approve` function in the provided code does return a boolean value, it does not correctly implement the standard behavior of the `approve` function as defined by the ERC-20 standard. The standard behavior is to set the allowance for the `_spender` to the `_value` provided, but the code provided adds the `_value` to the current allowance, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities (e.g., the approve/transferFrom attack vector).

The correct implementation should set the allowance to `_value` rather than adding to it:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    _allowances[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

Additionally, the code uses `Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);` which is incorrect syntax for emitting events in Solidity. The correct syntax uses the `emit` keyword: `emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);`.

Therefore, the code violates the given ERC rule by not correctly implementing the `approve` function according to the ERC-20 standard.
