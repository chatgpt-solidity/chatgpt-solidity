YES

The given Solidity code for the `Organicco` contract includes a `transfer` function that is intended to emit a `Transfer` event when tokens are transferred. However, the code uses the syntax `Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);` which is incorrect for emitting events in Solidity.

The correct syntax for emitting events in Solidity is to use the `emit` keyword followed by the event name and the parameters in parentheses. The correct line should be `emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);`.

Since the code does not use the `emit` keyword, it violates the given ERC rule that states "emit Event Transfer."
