The provided Solidity code defines a function `balanceOf` that takes an address `_addr` and returns the balance of that address. This is in line with the ERC rule that states a function should return the account balance of another account with address `_owner`. The parameter name `_addr` is used instead of `_owner`, but this is a matter of naming convention and does not affect the compliance with the rule. The function still serves the purpose of returning the balance of the provided address, which is what the rule requires.
