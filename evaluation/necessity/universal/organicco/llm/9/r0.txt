YES

The given Solidity code for the `Organicco` contract's `transfer` function includes a condition that checks if the `_value` to be transferred is greater than 0:

```solidity
if (
    _value > 0 && _value <= _balanceOf[msg.sender] && !isContract(_to)
)
```

According to the provided ERC rule, transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers. However, the code explicitly prevents transfers of 0 value by requiring `_value` to be greater than 0. This means that the code does not comply with the ERC rule that states transfers of 0 values must be treated the same as any other transfer.
