NO

The given Solidity code does not explicitly throw a message stating "caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend" when the balance is insufficient. Instead, the code uses the SafeMath library to perform subtraction, which will revert the transaction with an assertion error if the sender does not have enough balance (due to the `assert(b <= a);` statement in the `sub` function). However, it does not provide a custom error message as specified by the ERC rule.
