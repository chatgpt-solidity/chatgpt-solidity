YES

The given Solidity code snippet defines a `transferFrom` function within a `StandardToken` contract that appears to be implementing an ERC token standard (likely ERC-20 based on the context). The function is meant to transfer tokens from one address to another, given that certain conditions are met.

The ERC rule provided states that the contract should "emit Event Transfer" when a transfer occurs. In Solidity, events are emitted using the `emit` keyword followed by the event name and the parameters to log.

In the provided code, the line `Transfer(_from, _to, _value);` is intended to emit the Transfer event, but it does not use the `emit` keyword, which is required by the Solidity language (starting from version 0.4.21). The correct syntax should be `emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);`.

Therefore, the code violates the given ERC rule by not using the `emit` keyword when emitting the Transfer event.
