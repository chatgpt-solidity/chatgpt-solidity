YES

The given Solidity code for the `transfer` function checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 before proceeding with the transfer:

```solidity
if (balances[msg.sender] >= _value && _value > 0) {
```

According to the provided ERC rule, transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers. However, the code explicitly prevents transfers of 0 values by requiring `_value > 0`. This means that if `_value` is 0, the function will return false and not treat it as a normal transfer, thus violating the given ERC rule.
