The provided Solidity code snippet does not show any functionality related to burning or deallocating tokens. The constructor function initializes the contract with a total supply and assigns the initial supply to the creator's address, but there is no function included in the snippet that would indicate a token burn mechanism. Therefore, the answer to whether the code contains the condition "tokens are burning or deallocating" is:

NO

Regarding the ERC rule "emit Event Transfer," the provided code does not include any event emissions, specifically the Transfer event which is a standard event in ERC-20 tokens that should be emitted when tokens are transferred. Since the code snippet does not show any functions that transfer tokens or emit any events, it does not comply with the ERC rule to emit a Transfer event upon token transfers. Therefore, the answer to whether the code violates the given ERC rule is:

YES

Please note that the provided code is incomplete, and the full contract might include additional functions and event emissions that are not visible in the snippet.
