NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule based on the information provided. The code snippet shows a `transferFrom` function that is commonly found in ERC-20 compliant tokens. The function checks if the `_from` account has enough balance, if the `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer the specified `_value` from the `_from` account, and if the `_value` is greater than 0.

The `allowed` mapping is used to keep track of allowances, which is the mechanism by which an account (`_from`) can authorize another account (`msg.sender`) to transfer tokens on its behalf. If the `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to `_value`, it implies that the `_from` account has indeed authorized the `msg.sender`.

However, the rule you've provided is not very clear as it states "throw the _from account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism." This seems to be an incomplete sentence and does not specify a clear rule. If the rule is intended to mean that the contract should throw an error if the `_from` account has not authorized the sender, then the code does not violate the rule, as it checks for authorization with `allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value`.

If the rule is intended to mean that the contract should throw an error in some other specific case not shown in the code snippet, then without additional context or the complete rule, we cannot determine a violation. The keyword `throw` is also outdated and has been replaced by `require`, `revert`, or `assert` in newer versions of Solidity, but this does not constitute a violation of the ERC rule as stated.
