NO

The given Solidity code does not violate the provided ERC rule. The rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers. In the provided code, there is no explicit check that would prevent a transfer of 0 value. The condition `_value > 0` is not excluding the possibility of a 0 value transfer; it is simply part of the logical condition to ensure that the `_value` is positive, which includes 0.

However, it's worth noting that the code does not explicitly handle the case of a 0 value transfer differently from any other transfer. It allows the transfer of 0 value as long as the sender has enough balance and allowance, which is in line with the ERC rule that 0 value transfers should be treated as normal transfers.
