NO

The code provided does not violate the given ERC rule. The ERC rule states that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." In the provided Solidity code, the `transferFrom` function checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 as part of the condition to allow the transfer. However, this does not mean that a transfer of 0 is disallowed or treated differently; it simply means that the function will return `false` if the `_value` is 0, which is still a valid response for a transfer of 0 value according to the ERC standard.

The ERC standard does not specify that a transfer of 0 must succeed, only that it must be treated as a normal transfer, which includes the possibility of the transfer failing or succeeding based on the contract's logic. The code does not reject a transfer of 0 outright; it processes the request and returns a boolean result accordingly.
