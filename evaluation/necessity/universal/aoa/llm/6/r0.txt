NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule based on the information provided. The rule states that the `_from` account must have authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the code, the `transferFrom` function checks whether `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to `_value`, which implies that the `_from` account has previously set an allowance for `msg.sender` to transfer up to a certain number of tokens on their behalf. This is a common mechanism for authorization in ERC-20 tokens.

However, the rule is somewhat ambiguous as it does not specify what the "some mechanism" for authorization is. Assuming it refers to the standard ERC-20 allowance mechanism, the code adheres to this by checking the allowance mapping with `allowed[_from][msg.sender]`. If the rule refers to a different, unspecified mechanism, then the answer could not be determined without additional context.
