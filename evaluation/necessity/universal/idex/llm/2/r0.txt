YES

The given Solidity code does not explicitly handle the case of transferring 0 values. According to the ERC rule that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers," the contract should allow transfers of 0 values and treat them as normal transfers, which would include emitting a Transfer event.

However, the provided code does not have any condition that would prevent the transfer of 0 values. It checks for the sender's balance and for overflows, but it does not reject a transfer of 0. Therefore, even though the code does not explicitly mention handling 0 value transfers, it does not violate the rule since it would still process a transfer of 0 value as a normal transfer and emit the Transfer event.

Please note that the code uses the `throw` statement for error handling, which is an outdated pattern in Solidity. Modern Solidity code should use `require` for input validation and revert conditions. Additionally, the `Transfer` event is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it is assumed to be present elsewhere in the contract for the code to compile successfully.
