The code provided does not follow the ERC rule as stated. The ERC rule requires that the function should return whether the transfer is successful. However, the code uses the `throw` statement to revert the transaction in case of errors, which is an old practice in Solidity (prior to version 0.4.13). The `throw` statement does not return any value; instead, it reverts the entire transaction, including any state changes and Ether transfers, and consumes all provided gas.

In modern Solidity, it is recommended to use `require` statements for input validation, which can return a boolean value indicating success or failure, or `revert` with an error message for more descriptive rejections. The `transferFrom` function should be updated to use these constructs and ensure that it adheres to the ERC rule by returning a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer.
