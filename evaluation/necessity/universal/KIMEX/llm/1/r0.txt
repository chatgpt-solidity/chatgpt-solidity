NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly throw a message stating "caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend" when the balance is insufficient. Instead, it relies on the `SafeMath` library's `sub` function, which uses an `assert` statement to ensure that the subtraction does not result in an overflow (which would happen if the balance were insufficient). If the `assert` condition fails, the transaction will revert, but it will not provide the specific message as required by the given ERC rule.
