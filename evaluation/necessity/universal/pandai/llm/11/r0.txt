NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer amount of 0, nor does it treat a transfer of 0 value any differently from a transfer of more than 0. The code does not contain any logic that would reject, ignore, or otherwise handle a transfer of 0 tokens in a special way. Therefore, it complies with the ERC rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers.
