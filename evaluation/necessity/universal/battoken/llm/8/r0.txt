The code provided does implement a return statement indicating whether the transfer is successful or not. The function `transferFrom` returns a boolean value `true` if the transfer conditions are met (sufficient balance and allowance, and the value to transfer is greater than 0), and `false` otherwise. This is in line with the ERC rule that states a function should return whether the transfer is successful.
