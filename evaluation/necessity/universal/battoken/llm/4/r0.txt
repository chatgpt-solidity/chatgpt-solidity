NO

The provided Solidity code does implement a `transfer` function that returns a boolean indicating whether the transfer is successful or not, which is in line with the ERC rule that states "Return whether the transfer is successful." However, the code does not compile under the current Solidity standards for the following reasons:

1. The `Transfer` event is not defined in the provided code snippet. In ERC-20, there should be an event declaration like `event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);`.

2. The `transfer` function should be marked as `public` to ensure it is part of the contract's external interface.

3. The `returns` keyword should be followed by the `public` visibility specifier.

4. The `transfer` function should emit the event using the `emit` keyword, which is the current standard in Solidity for triggering events.

5. The `Token` contract from which `StandardToken` is inheriting is not provided, so it's unclear whether other ERC-20 functions and events are properly defined.

6. The `transfer` function should have the `view` or `pure` specifier if it does not modify the state, but since it does modify the state, it should not have either.

7. The `transfer` function is missing the `external` or `public` visibility specifier.

Here is a corrected version of the `transfer` function that would comply with the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
contract StandardToken is ERC20 { // Assuming ERC20 is a properly defined interface

    mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
        require(_to != address(0), "Transfer to the zero address");

        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }
}
```

This version includes the `public` visibility specifier, the `require` statements for validation, and the `emit` keyword for the event. It also assumes that `ERC20` is a properly defined interface that includes the `Transfer` event declaration.
