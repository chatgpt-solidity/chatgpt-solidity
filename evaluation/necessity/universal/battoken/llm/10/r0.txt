The given Solidity code for the `approve` function in the `StandardToken` contract does indeed return a boolean value indicating whether the `approve` operation is successful. The function sets the allowance for `_spender` to use `_value` tokens on behalf of `msg.sender`, emits an `Approval` event, and then returns `true`. 

However, the code provided does not include the `Approval` event declaration, which is necessary for the contract to compile successfully and for the `Approval` event to be emitted correctly. But this does not affect the return value of the `approve` function, which complies with the ERC rule stated. 

Please note that in actual ERC-20 compliant contracts, the `approve` function should also include checks to prevent race conditions and should follow the ERC-20 standard's requirements for the `approve` function. Additionally, the `returns` keyword should be followed by the visibility specifier (e.g., `public` or `external`) and the `emit` keyword should be used when emitting events in Solidity version 0.4.21 and above.
