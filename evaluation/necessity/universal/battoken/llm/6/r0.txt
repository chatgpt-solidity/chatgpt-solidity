NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule. The rule states that the `_from` account must have authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the code, the `transferFrom` function checks whether `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to `_value`, which implies that `_from` has previously set an allowance for `msg.sender` to transfer up to a certain number of tokens on their behalf. This is a common mechanism for authorization in ERC-20 tokens.

However, the code does not show the mechanism by which the allowance is set, which would typically be done through an `approve` function as per ERC-20 standards. Assuming that such a function exists and works correctly in the rest of the contract (which is not shown in the provided code snippet), the `transferFrom` function would be compliant with the rule as it checks for the proper authorization before allowing a transfer to occur.
