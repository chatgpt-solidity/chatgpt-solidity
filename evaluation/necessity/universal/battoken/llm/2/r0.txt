YES

The given Solidity code for the `transfer` function in the `StandardToken` contract does not use the `emit` keyword when triggering the `Transfer` event. The correct syntax to emit an event in Solidity is to use the `emit` keyword followed by the event name and the parameters to be logged.

The line in the code that violates the ERC rule is:
```solidity
Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

It should be updated to:
```solidity
emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

This change would make the code compliant with the ERC rule that requires the use of the `emit` keyword when emitting events.
