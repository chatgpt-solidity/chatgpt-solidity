NO

The given Solidity code for the `approve` function in the `RegularToken` contract does indeed return a boolean value indicating whether the `approve` operation is successful. The function sets the allowance for `_spender` to use `_value` tokens on behalf of `msg.sender` and then emits an `Approval` event. Finally, it returns `true`, indicating that the operation was successful. 

Therefore, the code does not violate the given ERC rule, which states that the function should return whether the `approve` is successful.
