YES

The given Solidity code for the `transfer` function in the `RegularToken` contract does not explicitly use the `emit` keyword when triggering the `Transfer` event. The `emit` keyword is required by modern Solidity conventions (starting from version 0.4.21) to clearly indicate that an event is being emitted.

The correct way to emit the event would be:

```solidity
emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

However, the code provided uses the older syntax which was allowed in earlier versions of Solidity:

```solidity
Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
```

This older syntax is not compliant with the current ERC standards that require the `emit` keyword for emitting events. Therefore, the code violates the given ERC rule.
