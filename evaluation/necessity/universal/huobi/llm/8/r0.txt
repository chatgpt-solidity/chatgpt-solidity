NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. According to the ERC-20 standard, transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, which means they should go through the same validation checks as any other transfer and emit a Transfer event if successful.

In the given `transferFrom` function, there is no condition that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated as a normal transfer. The function checks if the sender has enough balance and if the allowance is sufficient, both of which would be true for a transfer of 0 value. Additionally, the function would emit a Transfer event if these conditions are met, even for a transfer of 0 value.

Therefore, the code does not violate the given ERC rule.
