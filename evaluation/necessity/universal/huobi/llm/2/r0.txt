YES

The given Solidity code does not explicitly throw a message indicating that the caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend. Instead, it performs a check to see if the balance of the sender is greater than or equal to the value to be transferred and if the recipient's balance will not overflow when the value is added. If these conditions are not met, the function simply returns false without providing a specific error message. This behavior does not comply with the given ERC rule that requires the contract to throw a message under such circumstances.
