NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly violate the given ERC rule based on the information provided. The ERC rule states that the `_from` account must have deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism. In the context of ERC20 tokens, this authorization is typically done through the `approve` function, which allows a spender to withdraw up to a certain amount of tokens from the owner's account.

The `transferFrom` function in the code checks for an allowance (`allowed[_from][msg.sender]`) which implies that there must have been a prior call to `approve` that set this allowance. If the allowance is sufficient (`allowance >= _value`), and the `_from` account has enough balance (`balances[_from] >= _value`), the transfer is allowed to proceed.

The code does not show the `approve` function or any other mechanism of authorization, but the presence of the allowance check suggests that the contract is designed to follow the standard ERC20 pattern where authorization is required and expected to be handled outside of the `transferFrom` function.

Therefore, based on the given code snippet and the ERC rule, there is no explicit violation. However, without seeing the full contract, including the `approve` function or other related authorization mechanisms, it is not possible to definitively say whether the contract fully complies with the ERC rule in practice.
