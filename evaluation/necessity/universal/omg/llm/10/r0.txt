YES

The given Solidity code does not return a boolean value indicating whether the `approve` function is successful or not. Instead, it uses a `throw` statement to revert the transaction if the conditions are not met. If the transaction does not revert, it is assumed to be successful, but the function itself does not explicitly return a value. This is a common pattern in older Solidity code, where the absence of a revert (or throw) is treated as a successful operation. However, according to the ERC20 standard, it is recommended for the `approve` function to return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.
