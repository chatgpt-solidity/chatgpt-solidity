The given Solidity code does not explicitly check whether the `_from` account has authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism before performing the `transferFrom` function. The code assumes that the allowance mapping (`allowed[_from][msg.sender]`) contains the necessary authorization, as it represents the amount of tokens that `_from` has allowed `msg.sender` to transfer on their behalf.

However, the ERC rule you've provided seems to be a statement rather than a rule that can be violated by the code. It describes a condition that should be met for the `transferFrom` function to execute correctly, which is that the `_from` account must have authorized the sender. This is a standard part of the ERC20 token standard, where the `allowed` mapping is used to keep track of such authorizations.

If the rule is intended to mean that the code should explicitly check for some additional authorization mechanism beyond the standard allowance mechanism, then the code does not do this. But as written, the rule seems to describe the intended behavior of the allowance mechanism, which the code does implement through the use of the `allowed` mapping. Therefore, based on the standard interpretation of ERC20 allowances, the code does not violate the rule as it uses the allowance mechanism to manage authorizations.
