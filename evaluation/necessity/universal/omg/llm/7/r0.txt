NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer of a value of 0, nor does it have any logic that would prevent a transfer of 0 from being treated as a normal transfer. The `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract uses the `SafeMath` library to safely add and subtract values without any conditions that would treat a transfer of 0 differently. Therefore, the code does not violate the given ERC rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers.
