The given Solidity code does emit the "Approval" event as required by the ERC rule. The line `Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);` is the code that emits the event, although it should be updated to the modern syntax `emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);` to comply with newer versions of Solidity. However, the essence of the ERC rule is followed as the event is indeed emitted.
