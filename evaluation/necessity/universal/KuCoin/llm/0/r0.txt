YES

The code provided does not throw a message as specified by the ERC rule. Instead, it uses the `require` function to check if the sender has enough balance to send tokens. If the sender does not have enough tokens, the transaction will revert, but it will not provide a specific message indicating that the caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

The correct implementation according to the ERC rule should include a revert message in the `require` statement, like so:

```solidity
require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value, "caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend");
```

Since the provided code does not include this message, it violates the given ERC rule.
