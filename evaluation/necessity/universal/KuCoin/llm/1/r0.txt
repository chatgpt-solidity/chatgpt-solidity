NO

The code provided does not explicitly emit the Transfer event as per the ERC rule. The line `Transfer(_from, _to, _value);` is intended to emit an event, but the correct syntax in Solidity to emit an event is using the `emit` keyword, like so: `emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);`. Since the `emit` keyword is missing, this code does not comply with the ERC rule as stated.
