NO

The given Solidity code does not violate the provided ERC rule. The ERC rule states that the `approve` function should return whether the approval is successful. In the provided code, both implementations of the `approve` function in the `AxpirePausableToken` and `StandardToken` contracts return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.

In `StandardToken`, the `approve` function returns `true` upon successful execution, and in `AxpirePausableToken`, the function returns the result of `super.approve(_spender, _value)`, which is the result of the `approve` function from the `StandardToken` contract, also a boolean indicating success.
