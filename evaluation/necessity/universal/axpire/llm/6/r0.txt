The provided Solidity code does not explicitly show a mechanism for the `_from` account to authorize the sender of the message. The `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract checks if the `_from` account has enough balance and if the sender (`msg.sender`) is allowed to transfer the specified `_value` from the `_from` account. However, the code snippet does not include the part of the contract where the authorization mechanism (such as the `approve` function in ERC-20 tokens) would be implemented.

The `allowed` mapping suggests that there is a mechanism for `_from` to authorize a spender, as this is a common pattern in ERC-20 tokens, but the actual mechanism (typically an `approve` function) is not shown in the provided code snippet. Therefore, based on the given code and rule, we cannot conclude that the code violates the ERC rule since the authorization mechanism is not explicitly shown but is implied by the use of the `allowed` mapping.
