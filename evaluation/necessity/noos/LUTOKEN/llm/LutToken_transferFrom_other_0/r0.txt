NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly show any condition that would prevent the transfer of 0 values. The ERC-20 standard requires that transfers of 0 values be treated as normal transfers, which means they should succeed and fire the Transfer event.

The `transferFrom` function in the `StandardToken` contract checks for the recipient address to be non-zero and for the sender to have enough balance and allowance, but it does not check for the value being transferred to be non-zero. Therefore, it would allow a transfer of 0 value to go through, which is in compliance with the ERC rule stated.

However, it's important to note that the actual behavior also depends on the rest of the contract code and any other conditions that might be present but not shown in the provided code snippet. If there are additional checks elsewhere in the contract that would prevent a 0 value transfer, then the answer could be different. But based on the given code, there is no violation of the ERC rule.
