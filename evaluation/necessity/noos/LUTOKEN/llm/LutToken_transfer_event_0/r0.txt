YES

The `transfer` function in the `BasicToken` contract emits the `Transfer` event after successfully transferring the tokens. The `LutToken` contract, which inherits from `BasicToken`, overrides the `transfer` function but still calls `super.transfer(_to, _value);` which is the implementation from `BasicToken` that includes the `emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);` line. Therefore, when `transfer` is called on `LutToken`, it will indeed emit the `Transfer` event.
