YES

The provided `_transfer` function does not explicitly handle the case of transferring a value of 0. According to the ERC rule stated, transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, which means that the function should allow transfers of 0 value and emit the Transfer event.

However, the function includes a check that requires the sender's balance to be greater than the value being transferred:

```solidity
require(balanceOf[_from] > _value); // Check if the sender has enough
```

This check will fail if `_value` is 0 and the sender's balance is also 0, which would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated as a normal transfer. To comply with the ERC rule, the check should be modified to allow for 0 value transfers:

```solidity
require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value); // Check if the sender has enough, including 0 value
```

Additionally, the function should ensure that the Transfer event is emitted even for 0 value transfers. The provided code does not show the implementation of the Transfer event, but it is important to ensure that it is emitted according to the ERC standard.
