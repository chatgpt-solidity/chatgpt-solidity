NO

The provided `transferFrom` function and the `_transfer` internal function do not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. According to the ERC rule that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers," the functions should allow transfers of 0 value to proceed without reverting, as long as all other conditions (like the sender having enough balance and neither account being frozen) are met.

Since there is no explicit check in the provided code that would prevent a transfer of 0 value, the functions comply with the ERC rule. They do not violate the rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers.
