YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer, as per the ERC rule. The function returns `true` if the following conditions are met:

1. The balance of the `_from` address is greater than or equal to the `_value` to be transferred.
2. The allowance set by `_from` for the `msg.sender` (the entity trying to perform the transfer) is greater than or equal to the `_value`.
3. The balance of the `_to` address after the transfer will not overflow (i.e., `balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to]`).

If all these conditions are satisfied, the function performs the transfer by subtracting `_value` from `balances[_from]` and adding `_value` to `balances[_to]`. If the allowance is not set to `MAX_UINT` (which represents an unlimited allowance), the function also deducts `_value` from the `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` mapping. After updating the balances and allowances, the function emits a `Transfer` event and returns `true`.

If any of the conditions are not met, the function returns `false`, indicating that the transfer was not successful.

Therefore, the function adheres to the ERC rule of returning whether the transfer is successful.
