YES

The provided Solidity function `transfer` does violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The function includes a condition that checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 (`_value > 0`). If `_value` is 0, the function will return false and not proceed with the transfer, which is against the specified ERC rule. The correct behavior should allow transfers of 0 values to proceed and be treated as normal transfers, emitting the Transfer event accordingly.
