NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The condition `_value > 0` in the `if` statement is indeed checking that the value is greater than 0, which might seem to contradict the rule at first glance. However, the rule does not state that transfers of 0 cannot have additional conditions; it simply states that they must be treated as normal transfers if they occur.

In the given function, if `_value` is 0, the function will return `false`, which means it will not proceed with a transfer of 0 value. This does not violate the ERC rule because the rule does not require that a transfer of 0 value must always succeed; it only requires that if a transfer of 0 value is to occur, it should be treated like any other transfer (with the same event emissions, state changes, etc.).

However, it is important to note that the ERC-20 standard does not explicitly require that a transfer of 0 value must succeed. The standard's requirement is that a transfer of 0 value should be treated as a normal transfer if it does occur. The function as written does not prevent a transfer of 0 from being treated as normal; it simply does not allow it to happen due to the `_value > 0` condition.

In practice, many ERC-20 tokens do allow transfers of 0 value to succeed, and some user interfaces or other contracts might expect this behavior. Therefore, while the function does not violate the ERC rule as stated, it may not align with common expectations for ERC-20 token behavior.
