NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0, but it does not reject or treat a transfer of 0 value differently either. The function will execute the transfer logic regardless of the value being transferred, including 0. The SafeMath library's `add` and `sub` functions will operate correctly with a value of 0, and the ERC20 `Transfer` event will be emitted as normal.

Therefore, the function does not violate the ERC rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers.
