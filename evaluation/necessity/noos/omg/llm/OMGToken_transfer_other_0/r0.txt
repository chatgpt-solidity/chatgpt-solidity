NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `transfer` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer. The function adjusts the balances and emits a Transfer event regardless of the value being transferred, including a value of 0.
