NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The function checks if the `_value` is greater than 0, but this does not prevent the transfer of 0 values. If `_value` is 0, the condition `_value > 0` will be false, and the function will return false, effectively treating a transfer of 0 as a no-op, which is compliant with the rule. However, it does not explicitly reject the transfer of 0, nor does it handle it in a special way; it simply does not execute the transfer logic if the value is 0.

To fully comply with the ERC rule, the function should allow the transfer of 0 values to proceed and execute the transfer logic, including emitting the Transfer event. The current implementation does not do this, but it also does not violate the rule by treating 0 transfers as invalid or reverting the transaction. It simply does nothing, which is a neutral behavior.
