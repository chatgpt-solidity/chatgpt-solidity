The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code does not follow the ERC-20 standard rule for the return value correctly. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should set the allowance for a spender to a certain value rather than adding to the current allowance.

The correct implementation of the `approve` function should look like this:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    _allowances[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

However, the provided code is adding the new value to the existing allowance, which could lead to a race condition known as the "approve/transferFrom attack". This is not compliant with the standard behavior of the `approve` function as per the ERC-20 token standard. The correct behavior is to set the allowance to `_value` rather than adding to it.

Additionally, the `Approval` event should be emitted using the `emit` keyword for better clarity and to be compliant with Solidity version 0.4.21 and above, which introduced this syntax change. The provided code does not use the `emit` keyword, which is a minor issue but still worth noting for best practices and clarity.
