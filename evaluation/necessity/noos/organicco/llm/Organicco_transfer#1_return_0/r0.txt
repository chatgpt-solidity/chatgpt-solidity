The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code checks if the transfer value is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the balance of the sender, and also checks that the recipient address is not a contract. If these conditions are met, it subtracts the value from the sender's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance using the SafeMath library functions `sub` and `add` to prevent underflow and overflow. Then, it emits a `Transfer` event and returns `true`, indicating that the transfer was successful.

If any of the conditions are not met (e.g., the value is not greater than 0, the sender does not have enough balance, or the recipient is a contract), the function returns `false`, indicating that the transfer was not successful.

This behavior aligns with the ERC rule that the function should return whether the transfer is successful.
