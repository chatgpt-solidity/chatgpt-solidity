The function `balanceOf` in the provided Solidity code correctly implements the ERC rule by returning the account balance of the address `_addr` (which can be considered equivalent to `_owner` in the ERC rule description). The function accesses the internal mapping `_balanceOf` from the `Token` contract, which keeps track of the balances associated with each address, and returns the balance for the specified address. This behavior is in line with the ERC rule for the `balanceOf` function.
