Given a solidity function refundTokens and the related parts from a smart contract.
Whether the function refundTokens and its related parts explicitly contains the condition? Reply in "YES" or "NO".

Function(and related parts) to audit:"""

     * The same issue used to happen for Ether too but new Solidity versions added the payable modifier to
     * prevent unintended Ether transfers. However, thereâ€™s no such mechanism for token transfers.
