The `transfer` function in the `WiT` contract, which inherits from `AbstractToken`, is designed to return a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the token transfer operation. This is in line with the ERC rule that states the function should return whether the transfer is successful.

The `transfer` function in `WiT` first checks if the sender's account is frozen and if the entire contract is frozen. If either is true, the function returns `false`, indicating the transfer has failed. If neither is true, it calls the `transfer` function of the `AbstractToken` contract.

The `transfer` function in `AbstractToken` performs several checks:
1. It ensures the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
2. It checks if the sender has enough balance to transfer `_value` tokens.
3. It performs the transfer if the value is greater than 0 and the sender is not the recipient, using `safeSub` and `safeAdd` from the `SafeMath` contract to prevent underflow and overflow, respectively.

If all conditions are met, the `AbstractToken`'s `transfer` function emits a `Transfer` event and returns `true`, indicating the transfer was successful. If any of the conditions fail, it returns `false`.

Therefore, the `transfer` function in both `WiT` and `AbstractToken` contracts adheres to the ERC rule by returning a boolean value that indicates the success or failure of the operation.
