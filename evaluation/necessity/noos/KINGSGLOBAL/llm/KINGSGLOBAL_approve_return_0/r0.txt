YES

The given `approve` function in the Solidity code sets the allowance for the `_spender` to use the `_value` amount of tokens on behalf of the `msg.sender`. After setting the allowance, it emits an `Approval` event and returns `true`, indicating that the operation was successful. This behavior complies with the ERC rule that the function should return whether the approve is successful. Since the function always sets the allowance and returns `true`, it indicates success as required by the rule.
