YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful, as required by the ERC-20 standard. The function ends with `return true;`, which is executed only if all the `require` statements pass without reverting the transaction. If any of the `require` conditions fail, the transaction will revert, and no value will be returned. However, if the function completes without reverting, it signifies that the transfer was successful, and thus it returns `true`.
