NO

The function `transferFrom` in the provided smart contract code correctly handles transfers of 0 values as normal transfers. The ERC-20 rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event. The code does not explicitly check for a 0 value to reject the transfer; instead, it allows the transfer to proceed and correctly emits the `Transfer` event at the end of the function, regardless of the value being transferred.

Therefore, the function `transferFrom` and its related parts do not violate the specified ERC rule.
