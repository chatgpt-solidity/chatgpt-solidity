NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value in the `transfer` or `transferFrom` functions. According to the ERC-20 standard, transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, which means they should go through the same validation checks and emit a Transfer event.

In the given code, there is no condition that prevents the transfer of 0 values. The `transferFrom` function will subtract 0 from the sender's balance and add 0 to the recipient's balance, which effectively does nothing but is still a valid operation. The `Transfer` event is emitted regardless of the transfer amount, so a transfer of 0 value would still result in an event emission.

Therefore, the function and its related parts do not violate the specified ERC rule.
