The `transferFrom` function in the provided code does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard's requirements for the `transferFrom` function. While it does return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer, it lacks the necessary checks to ensure that the transfer is valid before it occurs.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should only allow a transfer to occur if the sender (`src`) has enough balance to transfer the specified amount (`wad`) and, if the caller is not the sender, the caller must have enough allowance to transfer the specified amount on behalf of the sender.

The provided `transferFrom` function does not check if the sender has enough balance before attempting to subtract the amount from the sender's balance. It also does not check if the caller has enough allowance (except for the special case when the allowance is not `uint(-1)`). These checks are crucial to prevent underflows in the balance and to ensure that the transfer is legitimate.

The correct implementation should include checks like:

1. Ensure that the sender has enough balance: `_balances[src] >= wad`
2. Ensure that the caller is allowed to transfer the specified amount: `msg.sender == src || _approvals[src][msg.sender] >= wad`

Without these checks, the function could allow unauthorized transfers or transfers of amounts greater than the sender's balance, which would not comply with the ERC-20 standard. Therefore, the function does not fully adhere to the ERC rule that it should return whether the transfer is successful, as it does not properly validate the transfer before it takes place.
