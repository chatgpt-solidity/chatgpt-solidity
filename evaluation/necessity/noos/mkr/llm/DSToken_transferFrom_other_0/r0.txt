NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value, but it does not reject or treat a transfer of 0 value any differently than a transfer of a non-zero value. The ERC-20 rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, and this function complies with that rule. It performs the transfer by adjusting balances and allowances (if necessary) and emits a Transfer event, regardless of the transfer amount. Therefore, it does not violate the specified ERC rule.
