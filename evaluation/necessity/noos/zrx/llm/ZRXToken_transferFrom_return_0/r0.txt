The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer, as per the ERC20 standard. The function checks if the balance of the sender (`_from`) is sufficient, if the allowance is sufficient (or unlimited if set to `MAX_UINT`), and if the transfer will not cause an overflow on the receiver's (`_to`) balance. If all these conditions are met, the transfer proceeds, the balances are updated accordingly, and the function returns `true`. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns `false`.

This behavior aligns with the ERC rule that the function should return whether the transfer is successful.
