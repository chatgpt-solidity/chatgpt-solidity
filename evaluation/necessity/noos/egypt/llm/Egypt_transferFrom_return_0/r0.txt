YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code correctly implements the ERC rule that it should return whether the transfer is successful. The function ends with `return true;` which indicates a successful transfer, assuming no exceptions are thrown by the `require` statements or the `_transfer` function.

If any of the `require` statements fail, the transaction will revert, and no value will be returned. If the `_transfer` function executes successfully, the function will return `true`, indicating success as per the ERC rule.
