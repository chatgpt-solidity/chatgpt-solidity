The `transferFrom` function in the provided code has a critical bug in the line where it updates the `allowed` mapping:

```solidity
allowed[_from][msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
```

This line should be updating the allowance based on the `_from` address and `msg.sender`, but instead, it incorrectly uses `balances[msg.sender]`. The correct line should be:

```solidity
allowed[_from][msg.sender] = allowed[_from][msg.sender].sub(_value);
```

Because of this bug, the function does not behave according to the ERC-20 standard, which could lead to incorrect allowance updates and potentially prevent the function from succeeding in a valid transfer scenario. Thus, the function does not always return whether the transfer is successful as required by the ERC rule.
