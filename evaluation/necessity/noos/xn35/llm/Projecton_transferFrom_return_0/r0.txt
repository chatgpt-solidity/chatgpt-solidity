The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. The function uses the `require` statement to ensure that the conditions for a successful transfer are met before proceeding with the transfer. If any of the conditions fail, the transaction will revert, and no further code will be executed.

The conditions checked are:
1. The `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer at least `_value` tokens on behalf of `_from`.
2. The `_from` address has a balance of at least `_value` tokens.
3. The `_value` to transfer is greater than 0.

If all conditions are met, the function performs the transfer by subtracting `_value` from the `_from` balance and adding `_value` to the `_to` balance using the SafeMath library functions `sub` and `add` to prevent underflow and overflow, respectively. It also decreases the allowance by `_value`.

After the transfer and allowance update, the function emits a `Transfer` event and returns `true`, indicating that the transfer was successful, which is in accordance with the ERC rule that the function should return whether the transfer is successful.
