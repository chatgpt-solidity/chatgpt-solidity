The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. The function ends with `return true;`, which means it will return `true` if the function execution reaches that point without reverting due to any of the `require` statements failing.

The `require` statements in both `transferFrom` and `_transfer` ensure that the conditions for a successful transfer are met before proceeding with the state changes. If any of these conditions are not met, the transaction will revert, and no state change will occur.

The ERC-20 standard specifies that functions should return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation. In this case, the `transferFrom` function adheres to this rule by returning `true` upon a successful transfer. If the transfer were to fail, the transaction would revert due to a failed `require` statement, and no return value would be provided because the transaction would not complete successfully.
