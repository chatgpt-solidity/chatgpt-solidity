NO

The provided Solidity function `transferFrom` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC-20 rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `transferFrom` or `_transfer` functions that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer.

However, it's important to note that while the code does not explicitly reject transfers of 0 value, it also does not include any specific handling or acknowledgment of this rule. The code will allow a transfer of 0 value as long as the other conditions (such as allowance and balance checks) are met.
