YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does indeed return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. The function ends with `return true;` which is executed only if all the previous `require` statements pass without reverting the transaction. If any of the `require` conditions fail, the function will revert and not return any value.

The ERC-20 standard specifies that functions like `transferFrom` should return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation. In this case, the function adheres to the standard by returning `true` upon a successful transfer. If the transfer were to fail due to any of the `require` conditions not being met, the transaction would revert, and no return value would be provided, which is also in line with the standard's expectations.
