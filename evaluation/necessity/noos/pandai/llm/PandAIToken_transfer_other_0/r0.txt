NO

The provided Solidity function `_transfer` and its related parts do not explicitly check for a transfer amount of 0. According to the ERC-20 standard, transfers of 0 values should be treated as normal transfers, which means they should go through the same validation checks and result in a `Transfer` event being emitted.

In the provided code, there is no condition that prevents the transfer of 0 values. The function checks that the `from` and `to` addresses are not the zero address and that the `from` address has enough balance to cover the transfer amount. If the amount is 0, these checks will still pass, and the function will proceed to emit the `Transfer` event without any issues.

Therefore, the function and its related parts comply with the ERC rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers.
