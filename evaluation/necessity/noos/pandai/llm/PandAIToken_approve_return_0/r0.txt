YES

The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code returns a boolean value indicating whether the approval was successful. The function ends with `return true;`, which means it will always return `true` if it completes execution without reverting due to a failed requirement or other exception.

The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `approve` function should return a boolean indicating the success of the operation. Since the provided function complies with this rule by returning `true` upon successful execution, it meets the ERC rule requirement.
