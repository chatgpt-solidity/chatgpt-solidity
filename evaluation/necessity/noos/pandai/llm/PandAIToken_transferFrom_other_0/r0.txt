NO

The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and its related parts in the ERC20 contract does not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `_transfer` function or the `transferFrom` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer.

The `_transfer` function checks that the `from` and `to` addresses are not the zero address and that the `from` address has a sufficient balance, but it does not check the amount being transferred for being non-zero. Therefore, a transfer of 0 value would proceed through the function and emit a `Transfer` event, which is in compliance with the ERC rule.
