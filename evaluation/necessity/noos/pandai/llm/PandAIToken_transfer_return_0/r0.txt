YES

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code returns a boolean value that indicates whether the transfer is successful. The function concludes with `return true;` which means that if the function execution reaches that point without reverting due to any of the `require` statements failing, it will return `true`, indicating a successful transfer as per the ERC rule.
