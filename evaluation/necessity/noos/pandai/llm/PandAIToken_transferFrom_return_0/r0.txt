YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code for the ERC20 token contract correctly implements the ERC rule by returning a boolean value that indicates whether the transfer is successful. The function ends with `return true;` which signifies a successful transfer, assuming no exceptions were thrown during the execution of the function.

If any of the requirements are not met, such as the sender not having enough balance or allowance, the function will revert due to the `require` statements, and no return value will be provided because the transaction will fail. If the function completes without reverting, it means all conditions for a successful transfer were met, and thus it returns `true`.
