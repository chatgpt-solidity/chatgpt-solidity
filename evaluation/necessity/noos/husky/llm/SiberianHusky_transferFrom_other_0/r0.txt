NO

The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and related parts of the contract does not explicitly check for a transfer amount of 0. The ERC-20 rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, which means they should succeed and fire the Transfer event.

In the given code, there is no condition that would cause a transfer of 0 to fail or be treated differently from any other transfer. The `require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");` line in the `_transfer` function could potentially violate the rule if it were to prevent zero-value transfers, but since this line is not present in the `transferFrom` function, it does not affect the behavior of zero-value transfers initiated by `transferFrom`.

Therefore, the `transferFrom` function and its related parts do not violate the ERC rule that states transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers.
