NO

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does not explicitly throw an error if the `_value` parameter (the amount to be transferred) is 0. Instead, it checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 as part of the conditional statement:

```solidity
if (
    balances[_from] >= _value &&
    allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value &&
    _value > 0
) {
    // ... perform transfer ...
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}
```

If `_value` is 0, the condition `_value > 0` will evaluate to false, and the function will skip the transfer logic and simply return false. This does not constitute a throw; it is a normal return of a boolean value indicating that the transfer was not successful.
