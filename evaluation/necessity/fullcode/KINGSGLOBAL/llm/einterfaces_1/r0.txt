YES

The given Solidity event interfaces contain the event `Approval(address indexed, address indexed, uint256);` with the correct parameter types and index attributes as specified. It is defined in the `Token` contract as follows:

```solidity
event Approval(
    address indexed _owner,
    address indexed _spender,
    uint256 _value
);
```

This matches the interface you asked to check for, with both `address` parameters being indexed and the `uint256` parameter being the correct type.
