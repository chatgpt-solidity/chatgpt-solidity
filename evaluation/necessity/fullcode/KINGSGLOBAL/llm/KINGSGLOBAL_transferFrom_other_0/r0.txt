The function `transferFrom` in the provided code does not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The condition `_value > 0` in the `if` statement is not rejecting transfers of 0 value; it is simply one of the conditions to check before proceeding with the transfer. If `_value` is 0, and the other conditions are met (the sender has enough balance and allowance), the transfer will still proceed, and the `Transfer` event will be emitted, which is compliant with the ERC rule. 

However, it's worth noting that the ERC rule is not fully reflected in the code, as the code does not explicitly handle the case where `_value` is 0. The code will work correctly for a 0 value transfer as long as the sender has enough balance and allowance, but it does not explicitly state that 0 value transfers are normal transfers. It would be clearer if the code explicitly handled the 0 value case, but as it stands, it does not violate the ERC rule.
