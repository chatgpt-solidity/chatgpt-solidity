NO

The provided Solidity code does not explicitly check for a transfer of a 0 value. However, it does not reject or treat a transfer of 0 value any differently either. The `transferFrom` function will proceed with the subtraction and addition operations even if `wad` is 0, effectively treating it as a normal transfer. The ERC-20 rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers is not violated by this code. 

The `DSMath` contract's `sub` and `add` functions will not revert if the value of `wad` is 0, and the `transferFrom` function will emit a `Transfer` event, which is the expected behavior for a compliant ERC-20 token transfer, even if the transfer amount is 0.
