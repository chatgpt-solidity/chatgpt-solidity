The `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract does not follow the ERC-20 standard rule that states it should return whether the approval is successful. The ERC-20 `approve` function should allow a token holder to approve another address to spend a specific amount of tokens on their behalf. The standard signature of the `approve` function is:

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
```

However, in the provided `DSToken` contract, the `approve` function has been overridden to only take one argument (`address guy`) and it sets the approval amount to the maximum possible (`uint(-1)`), which is not in line with the typical ERC-20 `approve` function that requires both the spender's address and the amount of tokens to approve.

Additionally, the `DSToken` contract's `approve` function does not allow the caller to specify the amount they wish to approve, which could lead to unexpected behavior and does not provide the flexibility that is expected from the ERC-20 standard `approve` function.

Therefore, the `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract does not meet the ERC-20 rule requirement of returning whether the approval is successful in the standard way, as it does not allow specifying the amount to approve.
