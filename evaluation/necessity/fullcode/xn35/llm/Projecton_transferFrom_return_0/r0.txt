The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. The function returns `true` at the end, which is in accordance with the ERC rule that states the function should "Return whether the transfer is successful."

The function uses the `require` statement to ensure that the conditions for a successful transfer are met before executing the transfer. If any of the conditions fail, the transaction will revert and not return any value. If all conditions are met, the function proceeds to update the balances, adjust the allowance, emit a Transfer event, and then return `true`, indicating success.
