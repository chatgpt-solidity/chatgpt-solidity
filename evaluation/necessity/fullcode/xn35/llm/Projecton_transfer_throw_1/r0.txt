The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code checks that the `_value` to be transferred is greater than 0 with the condition `_value > 0`. If `_value` is 0, the `require` statement will fail, and the function will revert the transaction. However, reverting a transaction is not the same as "throwing" in the context of Solidity.

In older versions of Solidity, the `throw` keyword was used to revert transactions, but it has been replaced by `require`, `revert`, and `assert` functions, which provide more control and consume less gas. The `require` function reverts the transaction if the condition is not met and refunds the remaining gas to the caller.

Therefore, if a transfer of 0 value is attempted, the `require` condition will not be satisfied, and the function will revert the transaction, but it will not "throw" in the traditional sense of the word as used in earlier Solidity versions.
