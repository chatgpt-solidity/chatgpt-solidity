The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code for the ERC20 token contract correctly implements the ERC20 standard by returning a boolean value that indicates whether the transfer is successful. The function ends with `return true;` which signifies a successful transfer, assuming no exceptions were thrown during the execution of the function.

The ERC20 standard requires that the `transferFrom` function should return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation. In this implementation, the function only returns `true` because if any of the requirements are not met (such as insufficient balance or allowance), the function will revert due to the `require` statements, and no return value will be given. If the function completes without reverting, it means all conditions for a successful transfer have been met, and thus it returns `true`.
