YES

The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code for the ERC20 token contract correctly implements the ERC rule by returning a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. The function performs the transfer by calling the internal `_transfer` function and then returns `true` to indicate success. There are no conditions under which the function would return `false`, as any failure in the requirements (such as insufficient balance or invalid addresses) would cause the transaction to revert due to the `require` statements. If the transaction reverts, no return value is provided. Therefore, the only possible return value from a completed transaction is `true`, which aligns with the ERC rule that the function should return whether the transfer is successful.
