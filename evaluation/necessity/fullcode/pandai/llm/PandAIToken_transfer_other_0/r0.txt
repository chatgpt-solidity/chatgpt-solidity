NO

The provided Solidity function `_transfer` and the related parts of the smart contract do not explicitly check for a transfer amount of 0. The ERC-20 rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, and there is nothing in the given code that would prevent a transfer of 0 from being treated as a normal transfer. The function does not revert or behave differently if the `amount` is 0; it will go through the same checks and emit a `Transfer` event as with any other amount. Therefore, the function complies with the ERC rule stated.
