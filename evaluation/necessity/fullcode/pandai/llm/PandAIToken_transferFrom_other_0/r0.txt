NO

The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and its related parts in the ERC20 contract does not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the code that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated like any other transfer. The code does not contain any special checks or rejections for the case when the `amount` is 0. Therefore, it can be inferred that a transfer of 0 value would proceed through the same steps as any other transfer, including checks for allowances and balance sufficiency, emitting the necessary events, and calling the `_beforeTokenTransfer` and `_afterTokenTransfer` hooks if they are implemented in a derived contract.
