The `transfer` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not. This is in line with the ERC-20 standard, which requires that the `transfer` function return a boolean value to signal the success or failure of the operation.

In the given code, the `transfer` function calls the internal `_transfer` function and then returns `true` unconditionally, which means that if the `_transfer` function does not revert (due to a `require` statement failing or any other reason), the `transfer` function will return `true`, indicating success.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function transfer(
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount
) public override returns (bool) {
    _transfer(_msgSender(), recipient, amount);
    return true;
}
```

As long as the internal `_transfer` function completes without reverting, the `transfer` function will return `true`. If any of the `require` statements within the `_transfer` function or any functions it calls were to fail, the transaction would revert, and the `transfer` function would not return any value (as the entire transaction would be rolled back).
