NO

The provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function and its related parts does not appear to violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The code does not contain any explicit checks that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer. The `transferFrom` function calls `_transfer`, which has a requirement that the transfer amount must be greater than zero (`require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");`). However, this requirement does not prevent the transfer of 0; it only prevents transfers of negative amounts, which are not possible with unsigned integers in Solidity.

Therefore, the code does not violate the specified ERC rule regarding transfers of 0 values.
