NO

The provided Solidity code for the `transfer` function and its related parts does not appear to violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The code does not contain any explicit checks that would prevent or treat a transfer of 0 value differently from any other transfer. The `require` statement within the `_transfer` function checks that the `amount` is greater than 0, but this does not prevent the transfer; it only ensures that the amount is a positive value, which includes 0.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the ERC rule, the function does not violate the rule.
