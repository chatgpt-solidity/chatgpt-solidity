NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and its related parts do not violate the ERC-20 rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The function `transfer` calls `transferFrom`, which includes a check to ensure that the value `_value` is greater than or equal to 0 with the line `require(_value >= 0);`. This means that the function will accept a transfer of 0 value and process it like any other transfer, including firing the `Transfer` event, which is in compliance with the ERC-20 standard.
