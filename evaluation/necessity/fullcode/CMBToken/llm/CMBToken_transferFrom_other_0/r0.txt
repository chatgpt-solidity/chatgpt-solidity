YES

The function `transferFrom` in the provided code violates the ERC-20 rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." This is because the function includes the requirement `_value > 0`, which will revert the transaction if the `_value` is 0. According to the ERC-20 standard, transfers of 0 should be allowed and treated as normal transfers, which means the function should not fail when the transfer amount is 0.
