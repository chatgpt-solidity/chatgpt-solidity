NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. However, it does not reject a transfer of 0 either. The function checks if the sender has enough balance and if the recipient's balance will not overflow when the value is added. A transfer of 0 would pass these checks because:

1. Any non-negative balance is greater than or equal to 0.
2. Adding 0 to any balance will not cause an overflow.

Therefore, the function complies with the ERC rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers. If the sender has a balance of 0 or more (which is always true), and the recipient's balance will not overflow when 0 is added (which is also always true), the transfer will proceed and return true, just like any other transfer.
