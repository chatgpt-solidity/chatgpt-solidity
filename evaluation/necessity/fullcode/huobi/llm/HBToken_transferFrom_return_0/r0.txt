YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer, as required by the ERC rule. The function checks if the balance of the `_from` address is sufficient, if the allowance is sufficient (or unlimited if set to `MAX_UINT`), and if the balance of the `_to` address will not overflow after the transfer. If all these conditions are met, the transfer proceeds, the balances are updated, the allowance is decreased (unless it's unlimited), the `Transfer` event is emitted, and the function returns `true`. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns `false`, indicating the transfer was not successful.
