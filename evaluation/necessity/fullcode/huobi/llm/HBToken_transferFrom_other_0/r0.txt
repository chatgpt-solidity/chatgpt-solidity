NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not explicitly violate the ERC-20 rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated the same way as any other transfer. The function checks if the balance and allowance are sufficient and if the addition of the value to the recipient's balance does not cause an overflow. If a transfer of 0 is requested, these conditions would be met (assuming no overflow occurs, which is not possible with a value of 0), and the function would return true, effectively treating a 0 value transfer as a normal transfer.
