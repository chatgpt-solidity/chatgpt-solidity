The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code is designed to return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful or not, which is in line with the ERC rule that states it should "Return whether the transfer is successful."

The function checks if the sender has enough balance, if the allowance is sufficient (including the case of an unlimited allowance represented by `MAX_UINT`), and if the transfer will not cause an overflow in the recipient's balance. If all conditions are met, the transfer proceeds, the balances are updated accordingly, and the function returns `true`. If any of the conditions fail, the function returns `false`. This behavior complies with the ERC rule.
