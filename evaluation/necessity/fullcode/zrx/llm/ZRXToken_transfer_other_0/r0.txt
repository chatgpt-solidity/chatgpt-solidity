NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value. However, it does not reject a transfer of 0 value either. The function checks if the sender has enough balance to cover the `_value` and if adding `_value` to the recipient's balance does not cause an overflow. If both conditions are met, the transfer proceeds, and the `Transfer` event is emitted.

Since the function does not contain any logic that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated as a normal transfer, it does not violate the ERC rule stating that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers."
