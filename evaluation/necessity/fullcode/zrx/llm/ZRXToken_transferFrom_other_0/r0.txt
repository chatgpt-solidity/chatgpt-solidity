NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. However, it does not reject a transfer of 0 value either. The function checks if the balance and allowance are sufficient and if the addition of `_value` to the recipient's balance does not cause an overflow. If `_value` is 0, these conditions will be met (assuming no overflow occurs when adding 0, which is a safe assumption), and the function will execute the transfer, reducing the allowance only if it is not set to `MAX_UINT`.

Since the ERC-20 rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, and this function does not prevent or treat 0-value transfers differently from any other transfer, it does not violate the specified ERC rule.
