The `transfer` function in the `DSTokenBase` contract calls the `transferFrom` function, which performs the actual transfer of tokens. The `transferFrom` function in the `DSToken` contract checks for sufficient balance and approvals, updates balances, updates allowances if necessary, and emits a Transfer event. It then returns `true` to indicate that the transfer was successful, which is in line with the ERC rule that the function should return whether the transfer is successful.
