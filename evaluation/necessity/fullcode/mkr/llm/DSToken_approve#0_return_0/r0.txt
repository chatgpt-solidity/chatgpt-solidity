The `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract does not follow the ERC-20 rule for the return value of the `approve` function. The ERC-20 standard requires that the `approve` function should return a boolean indicating whether the approval was successful. However, the `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract does not accept a `wad` parameter (the amount to approve) and instead hardcodes the approval amount to `uint(-1)`, which is a maximum uint256 value. This could lead to unexpected behavior and does not allow users to specify the amount they wish to approve.

Additionally, the `approve` function in the `DSTokenBase` contract does not check for the case where the approval amount is being changed from a non-zero value to another non-zero value, which is a known ERC-20 race condition vulnerability. The standard practice to mitigate this issue is to require that the approval be set to zero before a new non-zero approval can be set, or to use the `increaseApproval` and `decreaseApproval` functions to avoid this race condition.

The `DSToken` contract's `approve` function also does not emit the `Approval` event using the `emit` keyword, which is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard for the `approve` function. The `Approval` event should be emitted whenever approval is granted, to allow blockchain subscribers to track approval events.

Therefore, the `approve` function in the `DSToken` contract does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard's requirements for the `approve` function's return value and behavior.
