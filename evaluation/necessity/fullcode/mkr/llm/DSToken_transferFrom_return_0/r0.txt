YES

The `transferFrom` function in the provided `DSToken` contract does indeed return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful, as required by the ERC standard (presumably ERC-20 in this context). The function ends with `return true;`, which indicates a successful transfer, assuming no exceptions are thrown by the `require` statements or any other code within the function.

If any of the `require` statements fail, such as if the sender does not have enough balance or the contract is stopped (`stoppable` modifier), the transaction will revert and no return value will be provided. If the function completes without reverting, it will return `true`, signaling a successful transfer.
