YES

The function `balanceOf` in the provided Solidity code snippet correctly implements the ERC rule by returning the account balance of the address `_addr` (which can be interpreted as `_owner` in the ERC rule context). The function accesses the internal mapping `_balanceOf` from the `Token` contract to retrieve the balance associated with the provided address.
