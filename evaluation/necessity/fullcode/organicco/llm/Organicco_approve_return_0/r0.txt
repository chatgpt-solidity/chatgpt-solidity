The `approve` function in the provided Solidity code does not follow the ERC-20 standard rule for the `approve` function's return value as specified. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should set the allowance for a spender to a certain value rather than adding to the current allowance.

The correct implementation of the `approve` function should look like this:

```solidity
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    _allowances[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    return true;
}
```

In the provided code, the `approve` function incorrectly adds the new value to the current allowance with the line:

```solidity
_allowances[msg.sender][_spender] = _allowances[msg.sender][_spender].add(_value);
```

This could lead to a race condition known as the "approve/transferFrom attack". To avoid this, the allowance should be set to the new value directly, not added to the existing one. Additionally, the `Approval` event should be emitted with the `emit` keyword for better readability and adherence to the latest Solidity standards, although the code provided would still work without it as it's using an older syntax.
