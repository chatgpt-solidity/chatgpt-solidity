NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The function checks if the `_value` is greater than 0, but it does not reject a transfer of 0. It simply checks if the `_value` is greater than 0 as part of the condition to proceed with the transfer. If `_value` is 0, the function will return false, which does not result in any state change or event emission, but it does not explicitly reject or throw an error for a transfer of 0 value.

However, it's worth noting that the function should ideally handle a transfer of 0 value by treating it as a normal transfer and emitting a Transfer event, according to the ERC-20 standard. The current implementation does not emit a Transfer event if the `_value` is 0, which could be seen as not fully adhering to the spirit of the ERC rule, even though it does not explicitly violate it.
