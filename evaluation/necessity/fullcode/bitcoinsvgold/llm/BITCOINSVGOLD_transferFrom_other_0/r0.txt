NO

The function `transferFrom` in the provided code snippet does not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The condition `_value > 0` is not preventing the transfer of 0 values; it is part of a compound condition that checks if the `_from` account has enough balance, if the `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer the specified `_value`, and if the `_value` is positive. If `_value` is 0, the condition still allows the transfer to proceed, as 0 is not greater than 0, but it is not less than 0 either, so the condition does not fail.

The code does not explicitly reject transfers of 0 values, and there is no indication that a transfer of 0 would be treated differently from any other transfer. Therefore, the function complies with the ERC rule regarding 0 value transfers.
