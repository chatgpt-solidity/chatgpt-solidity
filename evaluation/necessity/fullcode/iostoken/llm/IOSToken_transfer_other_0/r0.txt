NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` does not explicitly check for a transfer of 0 value. However, it does not reject a transfer of 0 value either. The function checks if the sender has enough balance to cover the `_value` and if the recipient's balance will not overflow when `_value` is added. A transfer of 0 would pass these checks because:

1. Any non-negative balance is greater than or equal to 0.
2. Adding 0 to any balance will not cause an overflow.

Therefore, the function complies with the ERC rule that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, as it would allow them and return true, just like any other transfer that doesn't violate the balance or overflow checks.
