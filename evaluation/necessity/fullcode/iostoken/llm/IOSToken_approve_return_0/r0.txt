YES

The given `approve` function in the Solidity code sets the allowance for the `_spender` to use `_value` tokens on behalf of `msg.sender`, emits an `Approval` event, and then returns `true`. According to the ERC rule provided, which states that the function should return whether the approve is successful, this function complies with the rule by returning `true` upon successful execution of the approval.
