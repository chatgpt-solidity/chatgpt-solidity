NO

The function `transferFrom` in the provided code does not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." The condition `_value > 0` is not preventing the transfer of 0 values; it is simply part of the checks to ensure that the `_from` account has enough balance and the `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer the specified `_value`. If `_value` is 0, the function will still proceed with the transfer as long as the other conditions are met (i.e., the `_from` account has enough balance and the `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer at least 0). The function does not explicitly reject a transfer of 0 value, so it complies with the ERC rule.
