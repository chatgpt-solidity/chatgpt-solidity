NO

The provided Solidity function `_transfer` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC-20 rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `_transfer` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated as a normal transfer. The function checks for the sender's balance, that the recipient's address is not the zero address, and that the transfer will not cause an overflow in the recipient's balance, but it does not reject a transfer of 0 value.

However, it's important to note that the code provided does not include the event declaration for `Transfer`, which should be present in a complete ERC-20 token contract to comply with the standard. The ERC-20 standard requires a `Transfer` event to be emitted on successful transfers, including transfers of 0 value. Assuming the `Transfer` event is properly declared elsewhere in the contract, the provided function does not violate the specified ERC rule.
