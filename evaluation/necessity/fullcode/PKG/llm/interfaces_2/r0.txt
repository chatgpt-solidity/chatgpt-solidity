YES

The given Solidity interfaces contain the function `transfer(address,uint256)` in the `BaseToken` contract. The function signature matches the requested interface, with the correct parameter types (`address` and `uint256`) and no return type specified, which by default is equivalent to returning `bool` in Solidity for a successful transaction. Here is the relevant part of the code:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public {
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
}
```

Although the `transfer` function itself does not explicitly return a `bool`, the absence of a return statement in Solidity functions that modify state implies that the function will return `true` upon successful execution, or revert the transaction otherwise. Therefore, it matches the interface "transfer(address,uint256) returns(bool)".
