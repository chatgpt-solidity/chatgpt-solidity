NO

The given Solidity interfaces do not contain a function with the exact signature "balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)". Instead, what is present in the code is a public state variable `balanceOf` which is a mapping, and in Solidity, this automatically creates a getter function with the signature `balanceOf(address) public view returns (uint256)`. However, this is not explicitly defined as a function in the interfaces, and the keyword `view` is also not present in the requested function signature. Therefore, the given interfaces do not contain the exact interface "balanceOf(address) returns(uint256)" as described.
