NO

The provided Solidity code does not contain any explicit checks that would cause a transfer of 0 value to throw an error. The `_transfer` function checks that the sender has enough balance and that the recipient's address is not the zero address, but it does not check for the value being greater than 0. Therefore, a transfer of 0 value would not throw an error; it would simply result in a Transfer event being emitted with a value of 0.
