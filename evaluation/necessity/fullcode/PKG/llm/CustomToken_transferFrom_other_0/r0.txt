NO

The provided Solidity function `transferFrom` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `_transfer` function or the `transferFrom` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer.

However, it's important to note that the code provided does not include the entire contract, and there could be other parts of the contract that might enforce additional constraints on transfers of 0 value. But based on the given code snippet, there is no violation of the specified ERC rule.
