The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful. The function ends with `return true;`, which means that if the function execution reaches that point without reverting due to any of the `require` statements failing, it will return `true`, indicating success.

The `require` statements ensure that the transfer is only executed if the sender (`msg.sender`) is allowed to spend at least `_value` tokens from `_from`'s balance, the `_to` address is not the zero address, the `_from` address has enough balance to send `_value` tokens, and that the transfer does not cause an overflow in the `_to` address's balance.

If any of these conditions are not met, the transaction will revert, and the function will not return any value. If all conditions are met, the `_transfer` function is called, which performs the actual transfer and emits a `Transfer` event. After the `_transfer` function completes successfully, `transferFrom` returns `true`, complying with the ERC rule to return whether the transfer is successful.
