The ERC-20 standard requires that the `transfer` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful. However, the provided `transfer` function does not explicitly return any value. It relies on the internal `_transfer` function to perform the transfer operation, but it does not handle the return of a success status to the caller.

To comply with the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return `true` if the transfer succeeds without any exceptions. Here is how the function should be modified to comply with the standard:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

With this change, the function will return `true` upon successful execution, which aligns with the ERC-20 rule that requires the function to indicate whether the transfer was successful.
