NO

The function `transferFrom` in the provided code checks if `_value > 0` before proceeding with the transfer. This means that if `_value` is 0, the function will return false and not treat it as a normal transfer, which violates the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." To comply with the ERC rule, the function should allow transfers of 0 values to be processed in the same way as any other transfer.
