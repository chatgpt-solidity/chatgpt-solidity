YES

The given Solidity interfaces contain the function `totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 supply) {}` in the `Token` contract, which matches the interface "totalSupply() returns(uint256)" with the correct return type `uint256`. The `constant` keyword indicates that the function does not alter the state on the blockchain, which is consistent with a function that simply returns a value. The `supply` variable name is not relevant to the interface match; only the function name and the return type are important for this match.
