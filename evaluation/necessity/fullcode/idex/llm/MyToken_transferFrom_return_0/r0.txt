The `transferFrom` function in the provided Solidity code does indeed return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful or not, as per the ERC rule. If any of the checks fail (sender does not have enough balance, the transfer would cause an overflow, or the allowance is not sufficient), the function will throw an exception and revert the transaction. If all checks pass, the function subtracts the value from the sender's balance, adds it to the recipient's balance, updates the allowance, emits a Transfer event, and returns `true`. 

However, it's important to note that the use of `throw` is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity, and it is recommended to use `require` for argument validation and `revert` for more complex error handling. The `throw` keyword has been replaced by `revert()`, `require()`, and `assert()` in Solidity 0.4.13 and later.
