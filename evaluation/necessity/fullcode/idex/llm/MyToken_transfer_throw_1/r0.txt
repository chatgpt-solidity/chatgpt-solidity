NO

In the provided Solidity code, there is no explicit check for a transfer value of 0. The `transfer` function only checks if the sender has enough balance and if the transfer would cause an overflow in the recipient's balance. It does not throw an error for a transfer of 0 value. Therefore, transfers of 0 values would not cause the function to throw; they would be processed normally, and the `Transfer` event would be emitted with a value of 0.
