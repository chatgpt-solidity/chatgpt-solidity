YES

The given Solidity interfaces contain the function `transfer(address,uint256)` in the `MyToken` contract. The function signature matches the requested interface, with the correct parameter types (`address` and `uint256`) and no return type specified, which defaults to `bool` in Solidity for functions that can modify state. The function is intended to transfer tokens and does not explicitly return a value, but in Solidity, a function that changes state is assumed to return `true` upon successful execution unless it encounters a condition that causes it to revert (e.g., using `throw` or `revert()`). Therefore, it matches the interface "transfer(address,uint256) returns(bool)".
