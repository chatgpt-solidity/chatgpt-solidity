NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. According to the ERC rule that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers," the function should allow transfers of 0 value to proceed and be treated like any other transfer, including the firing of the Transfer event.

In the given function, there is no condition that prevents the transfer of 0 values. The checks in place are for ensuring that the sender has enough balance and to prevent overflow when adding to the recipient's balance. Therefore, a transfer of 0 value would pass these checks and be processed like any other transfer, which is in compliance with the ERC rule stated.
