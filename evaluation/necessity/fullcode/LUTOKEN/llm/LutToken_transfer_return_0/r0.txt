The `transfer` function in the `LutToken` contract does not explicitly return a boolean value indicating the success of the transfer. It calls `super.transfer(_to, _value);` which is expected to execute the `transfer` function from the `BasicToken` contract. However, the return value from `super.transfer(_to, _value);` is not captured and returned by the `transfer` function in `LutToken`.

To comply with the ERC rule that the transfer function should return whether the transfer is successful, the `transfer` function in `LutToken` should be modified to return the result of `super.transfer(_to, _value);` explicitly, like this:

```solidity
function transfer(
    address _to,
    uint256 _value
) public whenNotPaused saleOrUnfrozen returns (bool) {
    return super.transfer(_to, _value);
}
```

With this change, the function would return a boolean value as required by the ERC rule.
