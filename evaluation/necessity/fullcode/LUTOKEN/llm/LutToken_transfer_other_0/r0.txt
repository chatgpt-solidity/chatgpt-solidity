NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and its related parts do not violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `transfer` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer. The function checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the `_value` is less than or equal to the sender's balance, but it does not explicitly disallow a transfer of 0 value. Therefore, the function complies with the ERC rule.
