NO

The provided Solidity function `transferFrom` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `transferFrom` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated like any other transfer. The function checks for the necessary allowances and balances, updates the balances and allowances, and emits a Transfer event, but it does not have any special handling or rejection for a transfer where `_value` is 0.

However, it is important to note that the actual behavior also depends on the rest of the contract code and any inherited contracts or overridden methods that are not shown here. If there is code elsewhere that treats 0-value transfers differently, then it could potentially violate the ERC rule. But based on the given code snippet alone, there is no violation of the rule.
