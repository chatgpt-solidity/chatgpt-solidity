The `transfer` function in the `WiT` contract, which inherits from `AbstractToken`, is designed to return a boolean value indicating the success of the token transfer. The function checks for several conditions:

1. It checks if the sender's account is frozen (`require(!frozenAccount[msg.sender]);`). If the account is frozen, the function will revert and not return any value.
2. It checks if the token transfers are currently frozen (`if (frozen) return false;`). If transfers are frozen, it returns `false`.
3. If the sender's account is not frozen and transfers are not frozen, it calls the `transfer` function from the `AbstractToken` contract (`else return AbstractToken.transfer(_to, _value);`).

The `transfer` function in the `AbstractToken` contract performs its own checks:

1. It checks if the recipient's address is not the zero address (`require(_to != address(0));`).
2. It checks if the sender has enough balance to transfer (`if (accounts[msg.sender] < _value) return false;`).
3. It uses `safeSub` and `safeAdd` from the `SafeMath` contract to safely subtract the value from the sender's balance and add it to the recipient's balance, preventing underflow and overflow.
4. It emits a `Transfer` event.
5. It returns `true` if all checks pass and the transfer is successful.

The `transfer` function in both contracts adheres to the ERC rule of returning a boolean value to indicate whether the transfer was successful. If any of the checks fail, the function will return `false`, and if the transfer is successful, it will return `true`.
