NO

The provided `transferFrom` function in the `AbstractToken` contract does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. According to the ERC rule that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers," the function should allow transfers of 0 values to proceed and be treated the same as any other transfer.

In the given `transferFrom` function, there is no condition that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated as a normal transfer. The function checks if the allowance is sufficient and if the sender has enough balance, but it does not reject a transfer of 0 value. Therefore, it does not violate the ERC rule stated.

However, it is important to note that the `WiT` contract's `transferFrom` function could potentially return false if the `frozen` variable is true, regardless of the transfer value. This behavior is not directly related to the ERC rule about 0 value transfers, but it is an additional logic that could affect the transfer process.
