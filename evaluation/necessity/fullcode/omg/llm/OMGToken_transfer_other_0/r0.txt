NO

The provided Solidity function `transfer` and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `transfer` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer. The function deducts the `_value` from the sender's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance, and it emits a Transfer event, regardless of the value being transferred. 

However, it is important to note that the use of `throw` is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity, and it would be better to use `require` for assertions or revert conditions. But this does not relate to the ERC rule in question.
