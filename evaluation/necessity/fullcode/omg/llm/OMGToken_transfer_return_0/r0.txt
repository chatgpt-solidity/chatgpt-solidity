NO

The provided `transfer` function in the `BasicToken` contract does not explicitly return a value. According to the ERC20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful. However, the code snippet provided does not include a return statement, and thus does not comply with the ERC rule that requires the function to return whether the transfer is successful.

The `transfer` function should be modified to return a boolean value, like so:

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```

This modification includes a `require` statement to ensure that the sender has enough balance to transfer, and it returns `true` at the end to indicate a successful transfer, which is in line with the ERC20 standard.
