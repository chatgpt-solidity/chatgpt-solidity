NO

The provided `transferFrom` function does not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0, but it does not reject it either. The ERC-20 rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, and the given function does not violate this rule. It will execute the transfer as normal, even if the `_value` is 0, by adjusting the balances and allowances accordingly without any conditions that would prevent the transfer of 0 value.
