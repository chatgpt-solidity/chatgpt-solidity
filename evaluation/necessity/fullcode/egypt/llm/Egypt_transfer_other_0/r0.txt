NO

The provided Solidity function `_transfer` and the `transfer` function do not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. The ERC-20 standard requires that transfers of 0 values be treated as normal transfers, which means they should be allowed and emit a Transfer event. Since the provided code does not prevent 0-value transfers and would still emit a Transfer event in such a case, it does not violate the specified ERC rule.
