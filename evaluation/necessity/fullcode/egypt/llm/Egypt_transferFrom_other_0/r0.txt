NO

The provided `transferFrom` function and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC rule that states "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `_transfer` internal function or the `transferFrom` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being processed like any other transfer. The checks in the `_transfer` function do not include any that would fail for a transfer of 0 value, assuming the sender has an adequate allowance and the `_to` address is not the 0x0 address. Therefore, the code as provided does not violate the specified ERC rule.
