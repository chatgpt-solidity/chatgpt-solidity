NO

The provided `transferFrom` function and its related parts do not explicitly violate the ERC rule stating that "Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers." There is no condition in the `transferFrom` function that would prevent a transfer of 0 value from being treated as a normal transfer. The function checks for allowances and performs the transfer using the `_transfer` internal function without any special handling for a 0 value. Therefore, based on the given code, a transfer of 0 value would be processed in the same manner as any other transfer.
