NO

The provided Solidity function `_transfer` and the `transfer` function do not explicitly check for a transfer value of 0. The ERC-20 rule states that transfers of 0 values must be treated as normal transfers, which means they should be allowed and events should be emitted accordingly.

Since there is no condition in the provided code that would prevent a transfer of 0 value or treat it differently from a transfer of more than 0, the code does not violate the specified ERC rule. It will allow transfers of 0 value and will emit a Transfer event, which is in compliance with the rule.
